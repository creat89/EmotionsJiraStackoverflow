__label__sadness	this probably sound really stupid but i have noo idea how to implement jquery 's rounded corner ( ) . my javascript - fu be complete fail and i can not seem to get it to work on my page . can anyone show me a simple example of the html and javascript you would use to get them to show ? apology for my idiocy .
__label__sadness	i know that ilist be the interface and list be the concrete type but i still do not know when to use each #crd# . what i be do now be if i do not need the sort or findall method i use the interface . be i right ? be there a good way to decide when to use the interface or the concrete type ?
__label__sadness	i be very sad now ‚òπÔ∏è
__label__sadness	eruby be an external executable , while erb be a library within ruby . you would use the former if you want independent processing of your template file ( e.g. quick - and - dirty php replacement ) , and the latter if you need to process them within the context of some other ruby script . it be more common to use erb simply because it be more flexible , but i will admit that i have be guilty of dabble in eruby to execute file for quick little utility website .
__label__sadness	some more depressing news here : #hlink# ? externalid = tn_0
__label__sadness	that 's just a character requirement with an optional character afterwards : the parenthesis may not be require - i be not enough of a regex guru to know offhand , i be afraid . if anyone want to edit it , do feel free ‚Ä¶
__label__sadness	you be look for an equivalent of and i be afraid it do not exist explicitely in the stl. go for sebastien 's answer if it be correct for your stl implementation .
__label__sadness	might be an answer , but i be afraid i can not speak from experience .
__label__sadness	would #crd# be violate the the term of agreement with google app engine if #crd# be to use amazon 's s0 service with google app engine ? i do know there be restriction on what you can and can not do but i be not sure of this . have these #crd# combine feature , #crd# could provide #crd# heck of a system at a relatively low cost compare to host this with a host company . have anyone do this already or have hear of an application that combine the #crd# technology ?
__label__sadness	( lack of line break in comment be saddening ! )
__label__sadness	this be a method in java , that ( when k == ) in int [ ] arr have #crd# of k - combination int [ ] intems . in variable iloczyn be calculate product of element in this combination . in tmp be calculate sum of all such product . unfortunately , #hlink# ( tmp ) show , that when function end , tmp equal . this be very sad , because i need this variable for next calculation . what shoud i do ?
__label__sadness	do it make sense to start learn javafx if i do not have any background in ui programming ? be it more advisable to learn swing #ord# and then move on to javafx ? i try the on javafx website in netbeans and the code look extremely complicated to me . i be wonder if javafx be too advanced for a beginnner gui developer .
__label__sadness	that be really sad ‚òπÔ∏è
__label__sadness	ohh , well this be sad ! i find the error and it unfortunately just be a typographical error ‚Ä¶
__label__sadness	that 's sad :-( i do not need it for debugging , i need it for other purpose .
__label__sadness	i just get through this exact problem . what a pain ! if you be run a - bit jvm on a - bit window , make sure that you set the execution policy for the - bit powershell interface . i find my bit executable here : the - and - bit powershell environment be completely distinct so set the execution policy in #crd# have no effect on the other .
__label__joy __label__anger	as point out in the comment , you can read argument from the cmd line in the args area of the main method , for example : when run this with : it write out the name of the file . hope this help !
__label__joy __label__surprise	#crd# unique visitor per hour ? wow ! be this expert exchange or some ( other ) pr0n site ? üòâ
__label__anger	nope - give up and go for a completely non-ruby solution .
__label__anger	( really awful title . ) anyway : can i somehow make scala infer the type of in #ord# line ? this work as expect after add the type : and be certainly the expect type :
__label__anger	instead of load everything which be neither possible nor really desirable i would use a slide window instead - when you reach a certain maximum list size ( say i.e. item ) you automatically remove the top item when you add the next item to the bottom . if you scroll just right after the update this should not even be noticeable by your user .
__label__anger	visual studio crash as soon as i open aspx or ascx view from mvc project . if i delete all bin and obj folder from project , i can open aspx and ascx view page . but it crash again after compile . it start to crash after i move strong type model to different project . i get stick and can not go far , really frustrated ! i be use visual staudio sp0 . mvc , window xp sp0 . . net sp0 . anyone can help ?
__label__anger	coreplot : candle stick , how to set more distance between every stick when zoom in and zoom out ? when i try to zoom out , it look really terrible . how can i fix it ?
__label__anger	i hate write migration , but it 's important for the schema to stay in sync. what i would much rather do be update my and have rail notice , then run something which generate the appropriate migration base on the difference between the old version and the current version . be there a way i can do that ?
__label__anger	so i have also run into this problem . i have find a solution ( it 's terrible , be warn ! ) open unity and load your solution in monodevelop ( old version you can set the target framework more easily ) navigate to your project directory and open " assembly - csharp - vs " in notepad . change the line " targetframeworkversion " v0 to " targetframeworkversion " v0 you will have to do these step every time you load unity ( blah ) but it do work .
__label__anger	yuck , i really hate that option . but option be the way to do it . upvote for option .
__label__anger	yes , lily , but * why * ? it sound exactly what someone who develop a malicious piece of software would ask .
__label__anger	in vb . net you can , with the keyword ( i believe ) . but what you be try to do seem really horrible . just set them explicitly . it 's almost exactly the same amount of code .
__label__anger	@mario i disagree , while the answer be outrageously awful , it 's still an answer .
__label__anger	@joranbeasley you be right for the new format though ‚Ä¶ and i totally hate it ‚òπÔ∏è
__label__anger	to push it to heroku , you will have to add it to your repo . why do not you want to commit it ? it 's recommend to commit gemfile . lock in your repo ( unless you be develop a gem ) : when develop an app , check in your gemfile . lock , since you will use the bundler tool across all machine , and the precision enforce by bundler be extremely desirable for application .
__label__anger	ps really hate the response limit on comment .
__label__anger	nobody ? to do this with a button be really disgusting .
__label__anger	do you ever figure this out ? i have have to post a dupe because i can nt : #hlink#
__label__anger	i be try to compile code that i know to be work on other people ' machine but be throw a particular error on my system . specifically the error relate to the printf ( ) method the method printf ( string , object []) in the type printstream be not applicable for the argument ( string , double ) for instance do anyone know why this error be crop up ? there be alternative to use printf ( ) , but this be very annoying !
__label__anger	this be a problem with windows firewall that be very annoying from its introduction . and persist trough several version of window . i have #crd# question : be it possible to be disabled or at least require confirmation in xp / server ? do uac handle this in vista / server ? if it do not - be there any way to disable it ?
__label__anger	i use with ( ) i want to have the option to choose the month and year . i define this : but i really hate the dropdowns of . i want to have the option to choose the month and year as in it be possible ? ?
__label__anger	c be a cruel master !
__label__anger	@anyone who use assembla - be it 0mb per project or 0mb per account ? if it 's per account , then that 's awfully small .
__label__anger	flexmonkey may be more of a pain than it be worth . gorrilla logic claim it work with custom component but i have find this be not the case . anything with a renderer seem to have serious problem . it be a lot hard to set up test than they claim and the test be not stable . i have write test for #crd# component time now use hardcoded id . sometimes it just can not see the component and it die . they only have short paragraph explain test in their user guide and they only respond to question about how to set it up on their google group . i would avoid use this .
__label__anger	this be a disgustingly horrible hack , but it might get the job do :
__label__anger	i know i can configure command line argument in the run configuration but i want to run a java file multiple time with different command line argument . it 's a pain to change the run configuration every time . be there a way i can make eclipse prompt me for command line argument every time i run the program ?
__label__anger	how do i stop a browser refresh from happen when a flash object have focus inside a pop up window ? yes , i abhor pop up window too . yet we have a flash questionnaire that be be wreck from user who use refresh . i also already have j in place that effectively block refresh , until the flash get focus and the user press refresh . i have access to the flash through our flash developer , but he be uncertain of how to do this . the close we could come up with be to use the fscommand trapallkeys , yet it do not appear to be work .
__label__anger	so , the follow hack seem to work , but it 's really incredibly ugly imo , as it rely on you control the line - height and use absolute positioning . bad , it require you to know how many line there be in your text , which depend on the width of the div and the font - size , and probably require js to compute . anyway , after all the above disclaimer , here 's the hack : use #crd# divs with the same text , #crd# on top of the other . #crd# justify , #crd# center . then clip the justify #crd# . html css fiddle . of course , the above code be hard - code for the specific width . again , you will probably need js in order to compute the number of line in the div. i be pretty sure that until this get implement in webkit you probably wo not find an elegant solution for your problem .
__label__anger	oh , this be be a pain ! i probably lose hour on this . here be the solution : cmake use short ' c ' application to test / try thing . if the cmakelists . txt state that c ++ be use for the project , without also list c , then some of those short test incorrectly fail , and cmake then think those thing be not find . the solution be to change the #ord# line of cmakelists from this : .. to include c as a language : then delete , recreate it , and everything then work :
__label__anger	come on , you be worry about efficiency while your #ord# line of code be incorrect !
__label__anger	the answer with a guid be completely ridiculous ( no sense at all ) the console hwnd be of course give by getconsolewindow ( ) (!)
__label__anger	the problem be exact what mysql be tell you : you have too much datum for #crd# table . not only the number of field be count towards them , but also their size ‚Ä¶ but the real problem be in your database design , you have design a table that be cry out for help : ' split me up , split me up ! ' you should your design ..
__label__anger	@ravenspoint : if you want to create the object on the heap now and delete it after execution in an other thread , i should probably remind you of raii - > very bad programming style ! ! ! or do you want to make some silly synchronisation to ensure the datum be still valid , when be read by the new thread ?
__label__anger	everything in the terminal buffer . command history be easy , just ' history ' . sometimes there 's an exception or a log i want to grab , but it go off the screen or select - all be a pain . i want to make a cmd line tool that do it and maybe send it to a new gist .
__label__anger	i have search this and can not find it . i have try different plugins and different browser ( firefox , opera , and chrome ) . i have try most of the no flash plugins for each of those as well as disable flash plugins / addons in the setting . i also rename the file in i find by search the system . when i rename it , make firefox and chrome ask to install flash , but still : return : i be not sure what else to try without uninstall flash , but that will be a total pain in the ass for this . i also really do not want to use swfobject just to see if flash be at all instal which i can do simply with : any idea ?
__label__anger	what be that downvote ? it 's real and valid question , and i hate drm too !
__label__anger	reinnstalled xcode0 - same thing . awful !
__label__anger	i be experience exactly this problem ( and be in exactly the same world of pain ) : whereby i be offer an update to sql use linqtosql and it be fail with a because be set to . due to legacy database also on the server i be target , i be not able to re-configure the default connection setting as be quite rightly state in the accept answer in . my question be : how do you convince linqtosql to run a sql before execute an update ?
__label__anger	i can not believe that answer from a company . horrible !
__label__anger	every time i download the zip file it be corrupt !
__label__anger	i have notice this lag time also . its really annoying when you go to / usr / bin to tell firefox what app to use to open a file and it lag for #ord# .
__label__anger	this be annoyingly annoying ‚Ä¶ if you have a the need to export your regexbuddy history you can take a look at , which print to the console your history , also as json .
__label__anger	i want to bulkload my cassandra datum from node a to node b. when i set the ' listen_address ' of each cassandra . yaml file to localhost , they do not show error on console but the datum be never transmit . when i set each node 's listen address to their own local network [ eth0 ipv0 ] address ( ‚Ä¶ ) , i get the follow error . i can read from this error log that the application be try to access to port .. and i do not have no idea what on earth be go on . each node be on the virtual machine on the virtual box hypervisor . both os be centos . here be my cassandra . yaml ( the cassandra . yaml of target file be also configure the same way ) thrift_max_message_length_in_mb : can anybody give me advice ? i be really suffer as hell .
__label__anger	i build an xml - rpc server in python use simplexmlrpcserver , accord to the example in the python documentation . i be call it from a python client on the same machine . the body of the server function execute very fast on its own . but i find that xmlrpc client performance be excruciatingly slow , take #crd# #ord# per call . ( use xmlrpclib . ) a speed - up technique i find on the web ( ) do not help . my connect uri be : i be run python x0 on windows , but it work the same for - bit python .
__label__anger	do not use it . i hate std::pair exactly for this reason . you never know which be which , and since access to #ord# and #ord# be public you can not enforce contract either . but after all , it 's a matter of taste .
__label__anger	i recently work on a product that be target to . net . out of #crd# of beta tester , i can probably count on #crd# hand the number that already have . net . the rest have to sit through the absolutely painful . net install from microsoft ( ~ minute , and most of the time the progress bar stay near so people think it be break ) .
__label__anger	unless there be a very valid reason , password should hash . hash result in fix length string . there be not space argument to make , unless the system be store the actual password , which be arguably a terrible idea .
__label__anger	do not want to beat a dead horse , but it be really important that you understand that this be a terrible idea .
__label__anger	lately , bring the help window from visual studio be take a long time . even update the help system take an awful long time . be there something broken with my installation ?
__label__anger	@donquestion yep . my account be domain admin so it should be ok ‚Ä¶ really annoying problem ! arg
__label__anger	i really hate to answer my own question but i find the problem and the report be open as of right now . i only come across this by chance but it seem to work . i change the setting of display on sharepoint site to do not display . i never notice that option before so i give it a try . sharepoint be on the laptop which i do not know at the time and i know nothing about it , but at least it show on the screen now .
__label__anger	ergh , this optionbuilder have a horrible interface !
__label__anger	no you can not . that awful thing do not work in manage mode or mixed mode .
__label__anger	i get the follow when i build locally i get this error when build locally or on the team foundation server . not exactly sure how to solve it , have the iis app pool and web site run as the tfs user so it do not have any problem view the website but the error be really irritating as its always tell me my build be broken .
__label__anger	imo it be painful to debug as you tend to have no intermediary variable for inspection .
__label__anger	you should be able to add the attribute during onprerender ( ) . inamingcontainer be so painful sometimes ‚Ä¶
__label__anger	vineet , what you be try to do be a terrible idea ! if you ever find yourself have to engineer something as fundamental as that , take a step back and work out what else do it ! i do not really believe in the whole spoon feed so thing , but what mtwebster say be on the right track !
__label__anger	i be try to create some ad in admob , but on last step i always get error : but it do not specify where . i swear god , there be no error on whole page , all field be correctly fill , i see no red shape around field , everything match criterias write under field , but i stil get this error - without any explanation . have anybody same experience ? it 's totally frustrating ‚òπÔ∏è
__label__anger	i really hate jquery , your code look as if you be look forward to publish your project finalize with jquery .. anyhow ‚Ä¶ if your look to replace the jquery selector $ ( "" ) with a function you should know that the function require that it return a dom element . otherwise an error will be flag and java script with abort .
__label__anger	i really despise swfobject for this very reason . maybe you could give a try
__label__anger	no , it be extremely bad idea .
__label__anger	that 's a really terrible way to read in all your file . try this : this will return a list of datum frame , each of which be the content of the corresponding file . or , if there be other csv file that you do not want to read in , you can restrict the specification : and to combine everything into #crd# big data frame :
__label__anger	double be not compare that way in real life ‚Ä¶
__label__anger	your solution be subject to all sort of horrible html escape issue and possibly injection attack .
__label__anger	you have #crd# divs , #crd# over the other , and the #crd# on top be transparent . however , when you scroll you want the div on the bottom to hide as it go under the #ord# transparent div. you do not want the #ord# div 's to change to as soon as it go under the #ord# div. you just want the part that be under to be hide . i have google extensively for an answer : # answer make the div on top or . the problem with this for me be my background be a photograph , i.e. as you scroll down what you see be different , as oppose to a colour or a pattern . the " background " of the transparent div need to change as the real background change . # offer a solution to this use jquery however there be horrible , horrible issue with scroll lag in browser not firefox . folk , how do i do it ?
__label__anger	for someone who use the ctrl - w binding in vim habitually , it be incredibly annoying to have chrome os ask me , " wan to close this window , then ? " how do i remap key in chrome os ? can not find this top secret setting anywhere .
__label__anger	i be get very strange flicker on a wpf application of mine . it only happen with alpha blend content , only on my computer , and only with wpf application . at least i have not notice it with anything else . it 's really annoying ! have anyone else deal with this weirdness ?
__label__anger	there 's an error here : $ r0 only have #crd# result column ( which you have not give a name ) . be you sure you be use the correct variable because there 's no way that your code should work as you have post it . also your variable naming be really awful . use meaningful name instead of , , etc ‚Ä¶
__label__anger	the answer do not establish the same 's as add directly to the ajax call . so in order for jquery to do this properly i add this : where be a global variable . unfortunately , i have to write this extra line on every single ajax call . terrible ! maybe i will edit the jquery framework to handle this ‚Ä¶
__label__anger	tool - > option - > project & solution - > build and run " on run , when project be out of date : " select " always build " that 's it , have it myself , extremely annoying .
__label__love	@shlomihassid no worry !
__label__love	love susy , so far ! now i would like this initial layout ‚Ä¶ to turn into this layout on a small screen : be this possible use susy ? furthermore , i would want the ac - column to function as a single entity when they be in the same column , since i would like to give them sticky behavior .
__label__love	i would say spike should be part of the iteration plan . not just in time . they should be account for the story they belong to . even reading of part of the manual should be estimate . and now for the hard part : do not be afraid to give high estimate . realistic be always good than too low . üòâ
