__label__love __label__anger	i really hope you can help because i have been pulling my hair out on this one all day ! we are in the process of developing an estate agency website and as part of this i am looking to develop a cluster map for the homepage which will have links to all of the properties . i have got the map geocoding a couple of dummy locations from the addresses that i added but when i have added the code to create a cluster it does not appear to be working . i am starting to think i have not added enough locations for this to click in but the demo 's i have seen around have as little as markers . below is my code so far : i would really appreciate if you could test and any help or suggestions ! thanks in advance !
__label__sadness __label__fear	unless you are able to demonstrate the problem with displayed code then i 'm afraid there 's not much more i can do to help you out .
__label__anger	yeah , i know , i just ca n't figure out where the ' private ' is coming from . it 's very frustrating !
__label__anger	yeah - my solution to this was to limit ie users - they can only select a tiny subset of the rows and columns that fx and chrome users can . even then ie8 only just copes with maybe cells ( 5x5 grid ) , and remain hopeless . it brings back memories of late 90s web development and is an ugly thing to do , but what else can you do if their browser is so poor ?
__label__anger	as alexander said , you are comparing a string and a char . the sad thing is that the compiler already told you that , only it encrypted it in iso-stl - template encryption , which is more difficult to read that perl ! you may want to look at for decrypting c ++ stl error messages .
__label__anger	** i hate git ! ! what a crazy command line syntax **
__label__anger	it is specific , i 'm not asking for a discussion , i 'm asking for specific things people know of that are emerging .
__label__anger	( and even worse , the + or - is dependant on the order of registering the observers ! )
__label__anger	strings containing xml is an extremely bad idea and asking for trouble . use messages that have a defined schema.i had to rewrite significant portions of an app that used a lot of xml internally instead of types . it was horribly slow and impossible to figure out what was happening .
__label__anger	i created public and private key with cygwins ssh and pasted the public key into bitbucket account . says the ssh connection works fine ! ( so it should work ! ! ! ) then i post into mercurial . ini in tortoisehg and i post into the hgrc file . but then when i want to push tortoisehg says to me : seems to me something is missing here but what exactly ? edit : i do n't want to used tortoiseplink because it is super super super slow ! and https just cancels the connection after uploading several megabytes .
__label__anger	that 's horrible .
__label__anger	@johannes : do n't bother , he 's much too stupid and heinous to be worth helping ( see his comments on my answer , it 's a model of how to get help ) .
__label__anger	your are really violating the idea of tdd if your code if doing something different for the test . why do you only need to change it inside the test ?
__label__anger	the method in . net returns a by - ref version of a type , e.g. passing the type of returns a type representing . however , if you already have a , what is the mechanism for obtaining a plain old ? there does n't seem to be an opposite method to remove the by - ref modifier . at the moment i 've put a hack in place which re-builds the assembly - qualified name without an at the end of the type name and then loads that type , but this is horribly dirty …
__label__anger	stackoverflow has horrible formatting for vbs ☹️
__label__anger	horribly inefficient ! it re-encodes the image each time . try this instead .
__label__anger	this question is awfully vague … and does n't seem to have anything to do with programming …
__label__anger	if you can edit the code , you should just re-write it to use a custom api that does what you want . failing that , use maximilian 's technique , but be warned that it is a maintenance horror . if you can not edit the code , you can patch the import tables to redirect calls to your own code . a description of this technique can be found in - search for the section titled " spying by altering of the import address table " . this is dangerous , but if you 're careful you can make it work . also check out , which does the same sort of thing but does n't require you to mess around with the actual patching .
__label__anger	i absolutely despise working with pdf documents . but when i absolutely have to , i have been using . it has quite a bit of functionality , , and it is theoretically free . though to use it effectively it helps if you get the book that they push on their website . i 'm not certain if you can easily make thumbnails with it , but it has worked for me in generating and manipulating pdfs on every project i 've worked on so far .
__label__anger	i had a memory crash on uigraphicsgetimagefromcurrentimagecontext ( ) ... if you 're creating and releasing a lot of them , you should wrap them in a fresh autoreleasepool for each iteration . even allowing the nsrunloop to tick was not enough for apple / ios to do housekeeping on garbage lying around from this . e.g.
__label__anger	you might want to consider using , a replacement for windows ' terrible command - line chrome . it offers fully redefinable keyboard shortcuts plus tabs , so it 's ideal for irb .
__label__anger	i am working in vb . net and have a class , foo , that implements an interface , ibar . i have a list of foo 's , but i need to pass a list of ibar 's into a function , but i keep getting casting errors , even when i use directcast . my code is in both main and main2 i get mainworks works , but it would be really annoying and inefficient to have to do that everywhere i want to call this function .
__label__anger	such a strong argument without any " reference " , is completely useless because just opinionated .
__label__anger	" error starting recording " , every time . oh how i hate meaningless error messages !
__label__anger	i got to this question via the almighty google . to complement on what andrew said above , for those of you on osx you might want to take a peek at / applications / macvim.app/contents/resources/vim/runtime/indent/html.vim and the modifications necessary should become evident . i ca n't believe i spent so much time suffering from poorly indented < li > s !
__label__anger	if double logins presented , it skipped it … looks so terrible ))

__label__anger	james , the stack trace under that is just my function name . nothing more . very frustrating ☹️
__label__anger	upvoted scared the hell out of me when things stopped working ! !
__label__anger	damn .. that s what i was afraid of ! !
__label__anger	has anyone found a way to change the icon displayed in the office button in a2007 ? having converted an ms access app to , it 's very annoying that my app is now displayed as an ms office app instead !
__label__anger	i have recently found out that anything swing ( netbeans , idea ) is excruciatingly slow to paint the ui over remote desktop ( rdp ) . can you guys give me any suggestion for something that will work properly over rdp ?
__label__anger	this is a hack . it does not load the whole file into memory . i really hope you use python .decodelargejson.py if you notice some objects that can not be decoded then you can tell me and we can find a solution . disclaimer this is not the valid and best solution . it is a hack that shows how it can be made possible . discussion because it does not load the whole file into memory , regular expressions do not work . it also uses the python implementation and not the c implementation . this could make it slower . i really hate how this easy task is hard . hopefully somebody else points out a different solution .
__label__anger	@tdiop your users will still hate losing their selection though !
__label__anger	i have a window using a wpf listview / gridview bound to an observablecollection . the performance is utterly horrific . the application chokes trying to load - items and cpu usage spikes each time an item is added / removed / modified . profiling does n't reveal anything obvious . anyone have any suggestions ?
__label__anger	yes , but it 's tricky , since datetime parsing in sql is a pain in the neck .
__label__anger	the problem was due to a malfunctioning . very painful and a lot of time wasted .
__label__anger	i can not seem to figure out why the phpunit target does not output any test results even though i have tests in position . the problem i am finding is there is no indication as to what the problem is ! incredibly frustrating . the output is as follows : my build . xml is as follows : my system : vista , php , phpunit , phpundercontrol , cruisecontrol
__label__anger	with no offense , just as one developer to another , i 'm afraid that your idea seems terribly inefficient . it seems to me that instead of uniting sqlite databases you should probably be storing several tables within the same database file . however if i 'm mistaken i guess you could attach the databases and then use a view to simplify your queries . or make an in-memory table and copy over all the data ( but that 's even worse performance wise , especially if you have large databases )
__label__anger	it 's horrible ! no , seriously , i do n't like it .
__label__anger	on the root window is how xbindkey does it . be careful about having some alternative method of killing the grab though , it 's very annoying to have to go somewhere to into your own box just to kill that process … and that 's why , if it was me , + " echo ' moo ' > / tmp / moo - fifo " would be the way to do it . that way , you could also control it in any number of other ways you have n't thought of yet .
__label__anger	either you want to group or you do n't . now which is it ? ( this is why i really hate how mysql allows non-aggregates in ` group by ` )
__label__anger	bejesuz that 's ugly ! whomever wrote that should be flogged .
__label__anger	make a custom button : that 'll get rid of that annoying border ! 😉
__label__anger	after i changed my windows regional setting from my native language to usa , the problem has gone . do not forget to restart visual studio . really annoying problem !
__label__anger	i 've struggled with this in the past and tried to elevate permissions using caspol and it was a real pain . i ended up converting it to a click once app in minutes and never had a problem with it since .
__label__anger	i 'm using vbscript , all that does is reverse the setting of checkbox . checked , whichever way it is . as an aside , vbscript is awful to work in.
__label__anger	is there a way to have mod_wsgi reload all modules ( maybe in a particular directory ) on each load ? while working on the code , it 's very annoying to restart apache every time something is changed . the only option i 've found so far is to put below every import … but that 's also really annoying since it means i 'm going to have to go through and remove them all at a later date …
__label__anger	hours ? that 's pretty quick ! my last innosetup installation coding took ten days , and it still wo n't work right on vista . it installed an app library , some sample apps , created a database , installed and started windows services , and published a web site , but days is still far too long …
__label__anger	is it to use the viewdata argument ? as you already have seen that would be absolutely horrible . what i want to know is this : what is the recommended way to pass this sort of layout configuration to the partial view ? by using a view model of course : and then : and then : and then : and then : and so on …
__label__anger	so to do this i would keep a list of axes and when i delete the contents of one i would swap it out with a full one . i think the example below solved the problem ( or at least gives an idea of how to solve it ) : the extremely ugly for loop construct is really just a placeholder to give an example of how the axes can be swapped .
__label__anger	ahh got it . you did n't downvote me for simply asking you to explain a bit more did you ?
__label__anger	ended up being a bad dependency . i had to add it manually to get it all working . terrible !
__label__anger	in my case sometimes begins work after " source control / update " . actually , its terrible bug , you have no guarantees that you see actual list ! ! !
__label__anger	i 'm trying to test if a character in a string is a space , and i 'm getting extremely frustrated : i 'm not getting any errors and i 've looked online , but people on different forums say this is how to test for a space . uh .
__label__anger	although , using this outside testing is a horrible , horrible idea …
__label__anger	this is totally abusive if you intentionally are using this with resources that are managed .
__label__anger	the objective of my endeavour is to have a linux computer execute a command ( or maybe a local script - on the target ) over a local network . ideally , i would use ssh to do this but unfortunately my embedded target is running wince which is absolutely horrible . to do this , i would require an ssh server running on wince . i looked into the openssh port but it does n't work and development for that stalled six years ago . to wrap up , i am looking for an alternative solution to using ssh on wince . so , any ideas ?
__label__anger	why do you not want to store it in the assets folder ? that 's what it 's for . regardless , you ca n't reference your local hard drive for it . ( also , personal opinion , monotype corsiva is a horrible , horrible font ) edit : so i would add , you should be able to do it the way you 're doing it , you just ca n't use your local hard drive . just get a reference to your typeface as a , depending on where you are saving them ( e.g. ) and use .
__label__anger	the problem is that you never run the method , so the field stays at zero . it 's a really terrible idea to give a field and a method the same name .
__label__anger	i have a vb . net mdi winforms app . my users have been complaining about form creep ( as they call it ) , this is where each time you open a specific form within the main mdi window it opens slightly below and to the right of the location it loaded previously - i.e. it starts in the top left of the window and works its way down to the bottom right . i have to agree with them that this is extremely irritating , is there any way to prevent this ? the code to load the forms is : i can address this somewhat by setting the forms start - up positions to ' manual ' but then they just open directly on top of each other in the top left of the screen . any other so users come across this ?
__label__anger	in this case , i 'd keep the dostuff ( ) method but subscribe to it with : admittedly that wo n't please those who do all their event wiring in the designer … but i find it simpler to inspect , personally . ( i also hate the autogenerated event handler names … )
__label__anger	/ me works out more what your code does and screams in agony .
__label__anger	did n't notice the horrid inline jquery , remove it ! then open the browser console ( f12 ) and check for errors .
__label__anger	it 'll work , it is just incredibly annoying and spy - ware - esque .
__label__anger	when you say it did n't detect it do you really mean you were collecting everything and the packet you wanted was n't there ? i find that hard to believe . it does n't need any configuration , it just works . getting a sensible filter so it gets what you want and not loads of other crap is harder !
__label__anger	so , months later , here 's what i did to get this to work ( with gradle ) my groovy - fu is not strong , so i 'm sure that horrible bit in the middle could be simplified , but it work for now !
__label__anger	why use a ` mutex ` here ? the ` acquire ` method just returns a reference to an instance ( this is a reference type ) . whether the object referenced is mutable or immutable is irrelevant . the reference is to the same object no matter if the object mutates . why do locking ? even if the instance was not " singleton " or " read - only " , i.e. even if the field reference could change , since [ reference assignments are atomic ] ( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ /), there would still be no need for locking / `mutex ` . i will downvote this answer @ + net upvotes …
__label__anger	it 's very painful to add multiple tickets to trac or to have it as your own todo list . that causes people to use their own task management tools so tasks are then spread all around . is there any plugin or macro that would quicken the process of adding a ticket ?
__label__love	check out bruce dunwiddie 's excellent class . it provides really excellent information in the exception messages when you have this kind of mapping issue .
__label__love	excellent , this works perfectly ! thank you 🙂
__label__love	basically i am looking for the guidelines for how to approach on hard ware sizing for a given requirements . what are the parameters need to consider to arrive at sizing decisons . it will be really great if any body can help on identifing sizing details for appserver , webserver , database etc .. please
__label__love	i 'd really love the surrounding content to " scroll " up / down in like when using scroll - but would also love the appropriate div to " fade " in.
__label__love	excellent news , good stuff !
__label__love	excellent in my case use the following code thanks ! !
__label__love	awesome -- this approach will work ! thanks ! btw -- i 've followed your blog for quite some time ! thanks !
__label__love	+ . great question ! now , i have no clue about the answer , but i 'll stay tuned .
__label__love	thank you , i just want to be loved 🙂
__label__love	thanks for the excellent link !
__label__love	excellent resource , thank you ! !
__label__love	thank you so much as long you replace char ( ) with in the above this works great !
__label__love	this one is great !
__label__love	gosh ! you 're right ! ! ! excellent ! ! ! ! is there a way to expand it programatically ? i added . setongoing ( true ) ( to the top ) but it 's not expanded … ( not really the top because the first one is a notification when i 'm plugged to usb for tools developpement ) . thank you again my friend !
__label__love	i really enjoy programming in mathematica , and hence was looking for solutions in it .
__label__love	this is great ! thanks upvote
__label__love	that is simply awesome 🙂
__label__love	wow that was exactly what i wanted ! so the second solution i showed is somewhat similar to what he 's describing but he describes also extremely elegant triggers that would keep all the data fully sane without any external code sanitization ! i think i will go with that design !
__label__love	nicogranelli mentioned nancy ( ) . it 's really great ! plz check this project jabbr ( ) it 's a chat involving signalr and nancy . great job !

__label__love	@ergosys thanks that was extremely helpful ! ! somewhat related to what i asked … i 'll have a try on that tomorrow 😃
__label__love	thanks for posting this rob ! excellent work ( saved me a month of r&d ) !
__label__love	excellent question .
__label__love	excellent point ! thanks ! ! i did mean just the left side though … ( i should have specified that ) . was glad to learn your insight though …
__label__love	awesome ! ! thanks 🙂
__label__love	loved all responses ! i picked gordon 's because it allowed me to do an outer join and ignore rows that had an additional filtering parameter ( i did n't ask for this but i was able to implement that later ) . jbrooks solution was great because it had a smaller footprint and allowed me to leverage functions , and shree 's one was a little too verbose for my bigger project but still did exactly what i needed . thank you all !
__label__love	@marcinjuraszek : that 's an excellent idea , thanks ! just implemented it , however should i create an index for the ' rand ' column ? if i do , data infile takes ages to load the file . if i do n't , i get no results when i add : ` order by sb . rand asc ` . any thoughts as well ? @somesillyname : thankfully , these tables are temporary , so there are no row deletions .
__label__love	upvote excellent question
__label__love	totally awesome
__label__love	i have a slider built into my web page that s dimensions and ratio alter for different screen sizes , i need the images that i place within this slider to also alter for the same purpose . the code that i have does't seem to be working , i 'm a bit of a newbie to jquery and have pieced it together myself but i think that its essentially quite close to being functionalâ€¦ any help would be hugely appreciated ! m
__label__love	that answer was extremely helpful scott , thanks for the pointer on that !
__label__love	is there anyway to have two textview in one autocompletetextview result ? e.g. and so on … the arrayadapter only allows one binding for a view so how could i bind more views in the adapter ? like so : i 've created a new xml layout for the layout parameter in the arrayadapter except when i bind the textview to the string array , it only sets the text to the textview with the given id . i 've also searched through the other posts about this one and it did not suit my needs . if anyone could help that would be absolutely great 🙂 thank you .
__label__love	thank you , the first example was extremely helpful and i now have it working , thanks !
__label__love	i always seem to use get when working with data ( strongly typed or otherwise ) from the database and i have never really needed to use fill although i just as easily could use fill instead of get when pulling out and updating data . can anyone provide guidance as to the implications and gotchas of each method ? in what situations is it preferable to use one or the other ? any performance implications ? thanks in advance for the answers ! i love this community !
__label__love	you can use mercurial on google code now . i never tried git before but i 'm loving mercurial .
__label__love	thanks djuth , this works great and is very simple ! i have to admit it is pretty limiting though , for example , i would love to have it autocomplete a staff name and then return a staffid but i can probably play around with what 's added and parsed .
__label__love	i just followed your excellent recommendation --- thanks ! 🙂
__label__love	hi i have designed a query that returns a set of data such as : what i want to do in sql reporting services is to display data in a grid fashion . such as for the dataset i provide . i want it to auto page break when needed , etc. is there anything built in that i can use ? any recommendations on how to do this is greatly appreicated ! thanks .

__label__love	i know there is a lot of information out there on this but i 've searched and searched and still have not found the help that i need . essentially i 'm trying to fill the entire browser window with a background image that scales itself and retains it 's aspect ratio automatically at any size so that it can be viewed on any device . here is an excellent example of what i am trying to achieve : the background image , when sized to 320x480 then stretched from to expands itself to the right ! if anyone out there can shed some light on how this is achieved via css i would greatly appreciate it !
__label__love	hi barney , i think @edmorton 's answer is pretty pretty more powerful than my comment !

__label__love	there 's parts to this question , both about restkit : how can we post up values email and password , and deal with the response using the object mapper how can we map objects in a response we are expecting the following json response : what 's the correct way to map this out , we 've got a class setup for user and token , but all the examples i 've seen seem to not show something like this where there is two segments to the response , here 's the code we have at the moment : appreciate any help you can give on this , loving restkit so far !

__label__love	excellent , thanks !
__label__love	no worries , i know how annoying this stuff can be !
__label__love	love this solution !
__label__love	i really love the jquery validation plugins , look neat stylish and accessible , but as you know javascript can be turned off and boom your user can enter what ever he wants , therefore you should validate on server too , so what is the best approach here ? do double validation one with jquery and one on server side or is there a better solid secure way ?
__label__love	you can do it with but , you should look into jquery , an excellent javascript library which makes it really easy to do that plus a lot more ! it 's worth the small learning curve , trust me .
__label__love	i am wondering … is tree view / navigation possible to do ( and somewhat easily ) in xforms given a xml data structure ? if it is possible , where can i find a really excellent example ( code and hopefully a working form to view ) ? also , are there any tips you have for implementing this ? ( i 'm new to xforms , and only know the basics so far ) thanks so much !
__label__love	well , not free . but we have had very good results with nevron . their support is excellent as well . another good option is teecharts .

__label__love	excellent suggestion aleksey ! this seems to be a common need , so perhaps the scala gods might consider adding this to map
__label__love	thanks nat . the external data is large ( external search results ) so it 's not possible to keep it as a new list . we 're a sharepoint plugin so i ca n't guarantee that the bdc will be available at all installations . i guess i 'm kind of out of luck with your suggestions but i appreciate the answer !

__label__fear	i 'm developing a propietary ( non open source ) web application in asp . net , and i want to use the look and feel of joomla ( images , control distribution , etc. ) . is this illegal ? i 'm violating the license doing this ?
__label__fear	i was afraid of that !
__label__fear	is this valid ? what i 'm really worried about is can you specify type and also use def at the same time ?
__label__fear	we are working in real estate project , there we have image and video uploads in many places . we are started with in few places , but now we found an issue that it does not work if the flash player not installed in the browser . its working only after installed the flash player in browser . this is really worrying . we should not force user to install flash player to upload images / video . how to handle this issue ?
__label__anger __label__sadness	i have no answer , but i 'll 2nd the sentiment about the documentation quality for openssl … i 'm working with it now also ( just starting ) , and it 's horrible trying to find examples or documents for anything beyond simple operations … i feel your pain .
__label__joy	i have the following code for searching multiple keywords within a document title which works fine . i want now to have a column that shows the number of keywords that are found in each title row and order in a descendent way . for example if i 'm searching for " maternity leave " i should get something like this : name -- keywords found maternity leave policy -- annual leave policy -- maternity advice for mothers - to - be -- hope it makes sense , many thanks !
__label__joy	to convert raster images to vectorial images , i found ( free ) to do an excellent job ( comparable to vectormagic , which is not free anymore by the way ) . in inkscape , import your image and use the path / trace bitmap function . it has a lot of control . once you converted to a vectorial image , save it as a svg. then , using , you can convert to xaml vector data . ( path & canvas )
__label__joy	text to html and wysiwymg are really different things . a real time preview is cool feature … i 've seen a great example somewhere 🙂 hmm 🙂 )) here , at stackoverflow !
__label__joy	before you go that route , have you seen this : it 's a series of articles about writing effects ( supported in . net .5sp1 ) as fragment shaders that run on your gpu … pretty neat stuff !
__label__joy	great ! good to hear it . can you please accept my answer ? 🙂
__label__joy	excellent i was not aware of this !
__label__joy	there is another way … as the wpf application is coded with the . net framework , it is compiled to msil ( microsoft intermediate language ) . this means you can use a decompiler such as ilspy to decompile and view the code of baronreplays . this will give you some idea of how baronreplays works so you can implement the same ideas into your own code project….hope this helped ! rodit
__label__joy	my spd does n't reformat my code when i edit master pages . while i do n't know why your does , rejoice that there is an answer
__label__joy	i 'm in no way supporting mpmovieplayercontroller , but it does have a property for " initialplaybacktime " . depending on your need , this combined with the play / finished notifications and a timer / thread can provide some degree of additional control . it ai n't pretty though ! 🙂
__label__joy	excellent ! you should document that as an answer and accept it so many more people can solve this with a google search on ' single line of text ' 🙂
__label__joy	have you tried : i 've also seen samples that in the markup for the media display layout file they specify an element such as : good luck !
__label__joy	we have eclipse manage things the way it wants , and use ant4eclipse ( a set of ant tasks ) for continuous builds . works great !
__label__joy	no worries ! how do i determine the difference between template or class ?
__label__joy	old question , i know , but i found it while searching for a similar answer . unless the api has changed , the reason why harpo 's answer is n't working is because is an instance method , not a static method . but fear not -- there 's an instance of present in each instance of -- the property . so in your case , if you 're within a controller ( or , i suspect , a view ) : that should do the trick !
__label__joy	yes , it 's possible , juste remove the second parameter of your method ( it 's totally useless ) ans it will work ( i tested the code ) !
__label__joy	few things to make this work : your classname file should start with a capital letter , your config array must be defined as $ config = array ( ) ( and not $ var or any other name ) , your config file must be lowercase . the config file is passed through the constructor , so class ( $ config = array ( )) , you can then access and store the config variables on an instance variable . hope it helps : config file : good luck 🙂
__label__joy	i would recommend things : - calculate and combine polygons that are touching . this involves a lot of processing and hard math , but i 've done it so i know it 's possible . - create your own overlay instead of using kml in png format , while you combine them in the previous suggestion . you 'll have to create a lot of pngs but it is blazing fast on the client . good luck 🙂
__label__joy	not to worry i 've solved it !
__label__joy	is in so u need not to worry ! internally the data is always stored as text , so even if you create table with , sqlite is going to follow the rules of data type
__label__joy	great question ! i also find myself a little lost in wpf because of the amount of flexibility it offers and have been looking for guidance in how to choose fonts , layout , spacing , colors , etc. i 've had a hard time finding books or websites to improve my ui design skills , so i hope we find great answers here !
__label__joy	i do n't think there are any mature components too ( for what i saw ) . you can use some dedicated dhtml components , like . we use it a lot in our project for our customers , and it 's really great !
__label__joy	@codemonkeyking , no worries ! 😃
__label__joy	you should really take a look at sprox ( ) . it builds on restcontroller , is very straight forward , well documented ( imo ) , generates forms and validation " magically " from your database and leaves you with a minimum of code to write . i really enjoy working with it . hope that helps you 🙂
__label__joy	then perhaps might be of some help . if need be you could always do the registry editing yourself via api directly for the association … but up to you edit : also read the comments there , some good points eg the use of quotes for paths with spaces : @ " c:\somepath \ myapp . exe "" % """ also permission issues for registry access esp with vista … good luck 🙂
__label__joy	that 's great 🙂
__label__joy	i personally use for my company and have had great luck with it ! edit oops , i did n't notice the svn requirement , basecamp can help with the other stuff .
__label__joy	with what little i know , i 'd recommend looking at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/write_yourself_a_scheme_in_48_hours ( it uses parsec etc. ) but i 'm not leaving it as an answer because it 's quite possibly a terrible one . hopefully someone who knows better will answer ( and then i 'll delete this comment ) .
__label__joy	excellent point ! 🙂
__label__joy	here is an excellent article that might help : codinghorrorgenerally i would say : put restrictive chmod rules salt , salt , salt !
__label__joy	@petergrantbue : i 'm happy that my solution suits your needs . 🙂 please , accept my answer if it really helped you out . good luck with your game ! 😉
__label__joy	rebol ( ko only ) is based on antigrain geometry library which is opensource it seems really great , can opengl do better ?
__label__joy	is there a shorthand for a new line character in scala ? in java ( on windows ) i usually just use " \ n " , but that does n't seem to work in scala - specifically outputs in eclipse , ( sic ) from the command line , and from the repl ( great success ! ) works , but is there anything shorter ?
__label__joy __label__surprise	huh….it will be very great if modal case working in my situation ! ! ! i ca n't find any example in network of this realization ! ! !
__label__sadness	after looking at the answers below , i am very sad that this is an example of backwards progress for ssrs.
__label__sadness	now i think it is not possible in c ++ ( without explicitly qualifying the namespace ) , it 's so sad ☹️
__label__sadness	can somebody point me to a resource that explains how to go about having + iis web server clustered ( or webfarm not sure what its called ) ? all i need is something basic , an overview how and where to start . ca n't seem to find anything …
__label__sadness	i 'm very sorry about my horrible english ! only for this example i use radio button , i 'm considering using textbox too
__label__sadness	@btevfik .. that s very sad :(
__label__sadness	@bukes : that 's disgraceful ☹️
__label__sadness	since i am completely useless at regex and this has been bugging me for the past half an hour , i think i 'll post this up here as it 's probably quite simple . in php i need to extract what 's between the tags example :
__label__sadness	here is my php code….i 'm extremely crappy with my javascript code , could someone help me convert this ? i basically want to convert a variable such as " marine - heavy " to " marine ( heavy ) " .
__label__sadness	☹️ ☹️ ☹️ ☹️ ☹️ ☹️
__label__sadness	i store ranges in mysql db , but a lot of queries to mysql for getting provider name - it 's terrible ☹️
__label__sadness	sorry , i was n't clear . you would need to add that as a bool property on your class . it originally sounded as if you had a single place that handled the notifications and displayed the errors .
__label__sadness	i 'm afraid you ca n't ! ! weka is not covering that functionality .
__label__sadness	why is powerbuilder community so small ? if i have asked anything about jquery / .net / php , there would have been at least - answers by now ☹️
__label__sadness	i do n't want this to be the answer , ( sob ) !
__label__sadness	unfortunately some projects require hundreds of images for css , general site images and flash then there can be hundreds of pdf 's , docs which are needed for the site . including them can mean it takes ages to load a project and sync it . if your unlucky enough to use vss then this is far more painful .
__label__sadness	ok , then , no solution that going db mysql … so sad ! ☹️ i will close the question !
__label__love __label__joy	@ajreal no worries , i think i managed to fix it !
__label__love __label__joy	never knew about vs macros . it 's awesome ! ! ! just what i need in a couple scenarios . thanks a lot
__label__love __label__joy	@paulmougel , thanks super great ! it works ! i added it ( res . end ( )) habitually and have never thought it might could be the reason . happy new year . thank again you so much .
__label__love __label__joy	this is a really great dbgrid ! just give it a try , you will not regret it .
__label__love __label__joy	is hugely useful 🙂 i 'm sure it could be improved a bit further with computing the name of the directory once and re-using it , but this is nicer - enough that i 'm fine stopping here . 🙂
__label__love __label__joy	i found an excellent tutorial on how to create site columns and content types - here : ( thanks again rob ! ) does anyone know of a written or video tutorial that will explain how to create a list and list instance in moss . i use wsp builder , and the build in templates from microsoft are n't compatible ( or up to the task ) . preferably a method that focuses on the caml ( xml ) , and explains in detail the theory , and demonstrates how it is done . thank you .
