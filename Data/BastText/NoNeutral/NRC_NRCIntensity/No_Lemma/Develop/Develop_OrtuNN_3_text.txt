__label__joy	upvote patch looks good .
__label__joy	ok cool , this is just a matter of adding strings to the various [ notfound ( ) | https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/ -rc4/src/files/files.cpp#l160] returns in files . cpp there are a number of error cases in the [ browse | https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/ -rc4/src/files/files.cpp#l204] and [ read | https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/ -rc4/src/files/files.cpp#l204] endpoints , i 'd imagine one could change the javascript to generate bad requests which should be sufficient to test this ðŸ™‚

__label__love __label__joy	the patch looks good , and so do the tests . thanks . my only question is why were the following lines added to setup ? { code } conf . set ( yarnconfiguration.nm_local_dirs , " file: /// bin / echo " ) ; conf . set ( yarnconfiguration.nm_log_dirs , " file: /// dev / null " ) ; { code } the test seems to pass just fine without them , and i did not understand their need .

__label__love	hi digy , i like to know a bit more about this patch : ) what test case is it fixing ? ) how did you determine the race condition ? the changes to the threadclass is considerable and i 'm trying to understand why this was n't a problem in earlier versions . thanks . -- george

__label__love	thanks , jing !
__label__love	thanks zheng !
__label__love	thanks a ton for your review , todd . here 's an updated patch which addresses all of your comments except the following . bq. in editlogfileinputstream , why do we need to pass isinprogress as a boolean ? if it 's in-progress , that means we do n't know the lasttxid , so it would be invalid_txid , right ? so we can implement isinprogress ( ) by just comparing lasttxid . because in the case of pre-transactional elfis , we pass in invalid_txid , even though the log is not yet in progress . i 'm still working on producing an updated patch which also adds testing for the pending dn message queues .
__label__love	hi sascha , there is an overlap with ofbiz- , could you please check ? thanks

__label__love	thanks for catching this , i have fixed it .
__label__love	thanks , sravya !
__label__love	that fixes my testcase . thank you !
__label__love	otherwise , hopefully someone else will improve this code when they 've got some time .
__label__love	bq. though , pig itself compiled fine and is ready to go , the contrib projects ( owl , zebra , piggybank / hiverc ) did nt compile , i think because either it did n't download dependices of those projects or did n't include them in the build path . ashutosh , yes . i did realize it and as you rightly guessed , it is because the ivy - dependency list does n't have some jars that are actually being used by contrib packages . this is not an issue related to eclipse - classpath . however , there has to be a jira opened to solve this issue of downloading the missing jars by ivy . can you please file a jira for this ? thanks
__label__love	thanks again for this really great patch , andrew .
__label__love	i just committed this . thanks , raghu !
__label__love	hi charles , thanks for the confirmation â€¦ we will chat with willem , i 'm off today but will work for a couple of days this week â€¦ sergey
__label__love	applied . thanks simon !
__label__love	committed , thanks !
__label__love	applied patch with thanks to william .
__label__love	thanks for providing this update . will try to take a look at this sometime this week .
__label__love	hi , gianmarco , thanks for your concern . actually we need one additional step to make bin / pig work . we shall copy $ pig_home / build / pig- -dev.jar to $ pig_home / pig- -core.jar . this will be handled in ant 's " package " target when releasing . but if you check out from svn , we will do this additional step to work with bin / pig .
__label__love	thanks tom !
__label__love	upvote jihoon , thank you for your contribution . sergio , thank you for your review .
__label__love	i just committed this . thanks for the reviews , doug . ( btw the last patch did n't include the removal of lang / java / mapred / src / main / java / org / apache / hadoop / io / sequencefilebase . java , so i did that manually when i committed . )
__label__love	integrated to and trunk . thanks for the patch , anoop . thanks for the review , stack .
__label__love	i just committed this . thanks , tom !
__label__love	would you please try the patch ? thanks very much !
__label__love	applied the patch into trunk with thanks to luca after minor refactoring .
__label__love	thanks , applied ok .
__label__love	thanks alex . it looks like a good path to solve this issue .
__label__love	thanks to fabrizio for the patch .
__label__love	the code has been checked in. thanks to gordon for that .
__label__love	i 've just committed this . thanks eli !
__label__love	hi hairong , the speedups you measured with this patch are very impressive . it would be great to have it included in the system . the patch still applied successfully to current trunk when i tried it . so can you please go ahead and " submit patch " so we see how it does with test - patch ? and i 'll review it , and try to get someone else to also . thanks !
__label__love	thanks scott , i have committed your last work in svn with rev.
__label__love	committed @revision in trunk thanks lufeng , if and when you get around to the patch for .x i can review . the patches for tests are very welcome in nutch . thank you .
__label__anger	that 's my bad .
__label__anger	no , it 's not off the table , but it 's moot unless we decide we want cqlsh in-tree at all .
__label__anger	i do n't care what we do as long as we do n't change the attributes in jsp significantly .
__label__anger	turning off hints is basically intended as a " oh shit , something is broken with hints , let 's turn it off " switch .
__label__anger	of course , it could â€¦ ðŸ™‚ doh !
__label__anger	this whole thing is very distressing to me .
__label__anger	holy hell , i think i found one problem with turning a bignum into anything else .
__label__anger	a feature with wrong functionality is as bad as , if not worse than , a bad performance .
__label__anger	bad memory .
__label__anger	ah , that was my bad .
__label__anger	this sucks * so much * ...
__label__anger	stupid maven
__label__anger	django is a fullstack framework , click is not .
__label__anger	hell , this is gon na take me a lot of work to raise .
__label__anger	my bad .
__label__anger	hudson is stuck .
__label__anger	they do n't vote , they whine that something ( or everything ) sucks .
__label__anger	{ quote } you are messing down deep below hbase in dfs.
__label__anger	that 's weird .
__label__anger	i 'm not entering bogus reports for the hell of it ðŸ˜‰ matt
__label__anger	well , that sucks .
__label__anger	ok . stupid user error here .
__label__anger	my bad .
__label__anger	durrrh , that sucks .
__label__anger	seeking back is pretty inefficient in dfs.
__label__anger	weird .
__label__anger	i 'm confused .
__label__love __label__sadness	i am sorry for the delay in responding . if you think the new patch is read for commit can you check patch available and it will get back on the radar . is derbyall clean as well l ? i am not seeing the original path anymore . for future reference , i think it is good in general to keep the old ones there to see what 's changed . thank you so much for all your work on derby !
__label__surprise	thirdly , the scenario you present in which someone copies a subset of their schema would only error if that person also chose to omit the defaultsearchfield declaration -- but why would they do that ?
__label__surprise	what is convenient for the user to download two archives to run the project ( or install maven ) ?
__label__sadness	the patch here seems to be attached to a wrong jira . sorry about the confusion . i have re-attached the path here .
__label__sadness	thanks for the report , and sorry its taken so long to fix it .
__label__sadness	sorry ; i hit close by accident .
__label__sadness	i have n't had any time to try re-upgrading after having to back out , but i will be sure to let you know how it works out as soon as i get the opportunity .
__label__sadness	i missed the context .
__label__sadness	i opened [ hadoop- ] to fix a wrong url , but appart from that i do n't there 's still references to the old structure .
__label__sadness	i was n't able to reproduce the problem with the attachments . i saw appropriate error messages ; line numbers ; etc. however ; line number information was missing for the testcase idkeyerr10 ; so i 've committed a patch which remedies this .
__label__sadness	sorry for the delay , i 'm recreating the mirror now .
__label__sadness	sorry .
__label__sadness	i 'm sorry .
__label__sadness	sorry , you 're right .
__label__sadness	secondly reading this code i can see why this bug is happening , after completing stage above when adding the new item the code does " ordered - cancelled = quantity " which equates to " - = " .
__label__sadness	ah , sorry i misunderstood you .
__label__sadness	i was in too much of a hurry , sorry hold on a sec .
__label__sadness	thx for the confirmation , vm will be created along with dns etc. hopefully later this week . sorry for the need to be a bit formal . rgds jan i.
__label__sadness	sorry , i was not able to create one diff - file , so i added for every build . xml an own diff .
__label__sadness	no , sorry - priorities have been shifted around â€¦
__label__sadness	< pctony > herbert , sorry we can not do this . the scope of the blemlist aiui is at the svn repo level - and we run a single repo for all the asf projects . however buildbot works at the per-project level . short of perhaps re-writing all of our buildbot mechanisms from the svn master this is not do - able . sorry .
__label__sadness	hi lars , sorry about the delay in responding . good point about the treemap always returning result in a deterministic ordering . the patch itself i think is still beneficial because it removes a little bit of redundancy in the existing equality code . imo , the fix makes it easier to understand as well . in addition , the tests are beneficial since we were missing coverage there . i think it 'd be better if the fix were in sooner , but it 's probably not an issue if we moved it to .
__label__sadness	sorry , i was wrong about needing to fix gump - that just needs the build . xml patch to remove the copy of the files in lib.
__label__sadness	i found the ( sad ) attempt at a script you asked about and uploaded it to mapreduce- .
__label__sadness	sorry ivan , attach a new patch with -- no - prefix .
__label__sadness	sorry , i was trying to get to the wiki but it 's been a busy week .
__label__sadness	sorry that i think i missed some discussion in the mailing list . the implementation and test and breakiterator is attached .
__label__sadness	oops , my bad , sorry . i indeed did not ' svn add ' the new classes since i do n't have write access to the repository anyway . but this way ' svn diff ' goes wrong , of course . i will submit a new patch on monday when i 'm back at my working machine . i 'm really sorry for the incovencience !
__label__sadness	sorry ðŸ™‚
__label__sadness	running tests on this . will commit once it is done . sorry , this one fell off my radar â€¦
__label__sadness	fixed the bug description - sorry for the noise
__label__sadness	strange things going on . with google chrome , uploading patch files corrupts the file . with msie it worked . sorry for the noise . yesterday it worked normally â€¦
__label__sadness	yes it is a dup , thanks mike for taking care of this ( i planned to do this yesterday but did n't make it )
__label__sadness	sorry for letting you guys wait .
__label__sadness	yes , sorry .
__label__sadness	sorry , i 'd accidentally deleted the -- disable - eventfd from my compilation script .
__label__sadness	if you know of a way , please describe it .
__label__sadness	sorry jacques , i 'll upload another file .
__label__anger __label__sadness	this is pretty embarassing !
__label__fear	currently the user passwords are too insecure .
