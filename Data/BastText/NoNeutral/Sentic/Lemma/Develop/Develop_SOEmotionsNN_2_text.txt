__label__surprise	i be curious , should not the other question be mark as a duplicate of this #crd# ? this question be #crd# year old and have a high rate answer .
__label__surprise	i be work on java web application and use from and as a web server . when i build the project , build complete successfully but when i start , the file that create during build in folder , get to delete ! !
__label__surprise	this #crd# do not : why be that ?
__label__love __label__joy	i use and to embed the code formatting portion . work great for me ! 🙂 sample page :
__label__love __label__joy	excellent ! thanks .
__label__love __label__joy	good question . i notice method entry breakpoint slow thing down considerably when i be debug java program with eclipse . i hope someone have the answer !
__label__love __label__joy	i recently import about 0k record into a table that relate datum in #crd# table to datum in another table . however , my client have since request that a sort order be add to all 0k record . my hope be there be a nice clean way to auto generate these sort order in a sql update . the finished datum should look something like this : can this be do ? any suggestion would be hugely appreciate . -- anne
__label__love __label__joy	i find by martin fowler to be an excellent overview of a variety of ui architecture . hope it help 🙂
__label__love __label__joy	we have deploy 's plot pack in both activex and . net flavor with great success . great api , incredibly flexible , provide a toolbar that let s user pan / zoom / customize . it 's solid , have a long track record , relatively inexpensive , and be very fast . ( i be not affiliate , by the way . )
__label__fear	i be only generate the autogeneratedclass . the genericclass and its generichandler ( ) method be hand - code in a different assembly from the autogeneratedclass altogether . so i be afraid this wo not work .
__label__fear	i be afraid of that !
__label__fear	i be clean up the css on a fairly large ( and somewhat disorganized ) website . be there a simple way ( or a piece of software ) that will let me find , for example , all the " a " tag that be within " h0 " tag ? or all the " span " that be within " p " tag ? i want to modify some of these css rule but i be afraid i will break something hide somewhere . any advice ?
__label__fear	link list have operation which a fifo queue do not ( enumerate the list , remove item from the middle , etc ) . so personally , i would fear that if a list be use as a queue without encapsulation , then in future some fool ( probably me ) will fail to observe the fifo constraint .
__label__fear	sort the hash be also a possibility that i have consider . i be a bit concerned about memory usage , but i will worry about that later .
__label__fear	scary question !
__label__fear	i have a few class which do nothing except in their constructor / destructors . here 's an example i be a little concerned about future readability . be i be too " tricksy " here , with a variable ( " busy " ) which be never actually use in the code ? could some static analysis tool suggest they be remove , or be this idiom sufficiently common not to worry about ?
__label__fear	expect about user . i be worried that run + query ( should be much more than that ) will eventually result in a timeout … now i be worry whether i be create a discussion rather than a qna
__label__joy __label__sadness	sorry , you need to move that serializer before this one….i will update the answer no problem , django rest framework be really great , have fun with it !
__label__sadness __label__fear	sorry ! have some syntax issue , i fix it and it work now….what should i do with the question ?
__label__anger	@raubi : which bit ? it 's still go to be horribly inefficient for long sequence , as it 's still do an enormous amount of string concatenation .
__label__anger	do not repost your blog post .
__label__anger	i have a function name call setvalue , use in many class . also , i have a global function by the same name . when i press c - ] , it go to arbitrary setvalue function . how do i directly jump to the global setvalue function ? it be really pain to use tnext every time to find if the function global .
__label__anger	yeah , compile , but output be so horrible ! ! !
__label__anger	i would suggest flexunit for automate testing of library you be build but it be a serious pain to use for a full application .
__label__anger	there be a way to fix everything , but you will still hate the autotools until the end of time !
__label__anger	i be try to run a windows command in python that require admin access . i have figure out a way use runas , but it open a user account control pop - up , which almost defeat the purpose of the automation and be really annoying ! be there any way around this ? here 's my code for the admin command :
__label__anger	since changesets be become too many to handle because of many checkins , i be think of select multiple changesets then create a single work item link for code review purpose . it 's really painful to create work item per changeset and assign to a code - reviewer . be this possible ?
__label__anger	yes definately turn off that solution wide processing . it 's a hog .
__label__anger	i recommend virtualbox . every time i use vpc i soon give up because the performance be terrible . i run virtualbox with a vista virtual pc allocate 0gb ram and it run really well . in fact i do not really notice much slow down from run natively .
__label__anger	lotus notes….aaaaargh !
__label__anger	i absolutely hate how tab work in xcode . however , the only workaround i find that work decent be use the osx tab shortcut : ctrl + cmd + - > ctrl + cmd + < -
__label__anger	put datum in the id be a terrible , terrible idea .
__label__anger	hate ghost comment ! ☹️
__label__anger	i have a fairly large codebase with several directory and file and i would like to check out a view or have a view as of a give date ( septermber #ord# ) . i be manually check file history and do and this be extremely painful . i wonder if there be a way to do a checkout and load everything as of a particular day at once ?
__label__anger	i be extract some datum from sql server . #crd# of the column be a ntext column that have a blob of xml there . as i extract it , it look really ugly . be there any way to format the xml inside a sql server store proc ?
__label__anger	i just flash back to an old broderbund game … can not remember the name of it . awful cgi graphic , lot of cannon battle in old ship … maybe the #ord# pirate game ? damn , that be an awful game . have a rollup scroll in it .
__label__anger	my guess would be from a colleague who want to scare this person out of ever use ' this ' again . it can be fairly annoying when someone use ' this ' for every single thing they do . not that it justify lie to a new programmer , but i can imagine someone do this out of frustration .
__label__anger	or a work iphone example . with so many class it 's a pain to figure out what call what
__label__anger	no , they have stop work again and go back to the forbid message . incredibly annoying .
__label__anger	yes another reason to hate ie !
__label__anger	this be not really pythonic so much as torture , but here 's a short version ( with meaningless - character variable name , no less ! )
__label__anger	how be a question about host less programming related than this which get plenty of up vote #hlink#
__label__anger	most of the time when iphone program crash , compiler show stack with full of no 's , but these no 's do not make any sense to me . very rarely it point out where the problem might be and mostly there be these useless no 's . how you can make sure that when your program crash while development / testing , it show at what place this cause this crash ?
__label__anger	obligatory i be not a lawyer . be you violate the legal clause of the gpl ? probably not . ati and nvidia do this sort of thing with their graphic driver for linux . however , it 's important to note that linux be gplv0 ; this may have change with gplv0 . be you violate the spirit of the gpl ? yes , and judge from the way your question be write , you already know this .
__label__anger	enlightenment dr0 be package with opensuse but it 's a bit painful to use with kde app as there 's no obvious ( on the enlightenment site , google etc. ) way to provide a systray for kde app that require #crd# ( e.g. , ktorrent ) . anyone know of a way around this ? i be not use e for the eye - candy - i be run on a 0ghz celeron and kde ( ) performance be not exactly stellar so i be try out a few alternative .
__label__anger	what i want to know be , what do create ? what can i do with it ? what do it mean ? every tutorial without fail will avoid talk about the #ord# version entirely the reason the tutorial do not rell you what to do with it be that it really be totally useless ! it allocate a single and give you a pointer to that . the problem be that if you want an int , why do not you just declare #crd# ?
__label__anger	can you be any more specific about the scenario you have in mind ? " optimization " be a terribly broad category .
__label__anger	more of a caution than a fix . ensure you be not an administrator of your page as be #crd# fire both visible - to - connection and the else . very annoying !
__label__anger	in the end the answer be - yes - indeed . it be simply a delay between me add my google test account and it actually be recognize as such 😡 ! google should have a warning about this - in-app billing be a complete nightmare to code !
__label__anger	in general , this be a _ terrible _ idea . c ++ header be not intend to be include in an alternately namespace as be use here .
__label__anger	i do not use ironpython , but what i have read so far about it do not certify the " incredibly bad python implementation " [ typo fix ] .
__label__anger	make sense , and it 's very similiar to what i be do . #crd# ant task for stage and #crd# for production , and just use the default for local development . but pain arise from mainting different applicationcontexts which have almost identical content …
__label__anger	i get it … this be incredibly silly question ! static mean i just access it directly from without use it from the instance .
__label__anger	on python prompt it work fine ! ! can anyone have idea why my program be not work from . py file as import be work perfect from python prompt .
__label__anger	that spammer be horrible !
__label__anger	start with master page on day # - its a pain come back to retrofit .
__label__anger	i be get the same error when i try to submit a version update from the organizer . what solve my issue be use the application loader find in the directory / developer / application / utility . you will need to compress your . app file and send the corresponding . zip file . i use this for my initial submission as well , i just think i would try the new way . what a pain ! go with application loader .
__label__anger	be search and replace the only way to rename as asp control in the code behind file ? i find this extremely annoying , but it be the only way i can find . scenario : i will find a variable that need rename ( usually to meet name convention ) i will rename the variable in the aspx / ascx file . i will have to go in the code behind file and search and replace . i get annoy be there any good way - preferably that would not touch a similarly name variable in another scope in the project . i be on vs0 with resharper -- do vs0 address this perhaps ?
__label__anger	okay .. after allot of trial and error i do something ( complete desperation ) and it work ! this be too dumb , and if it be not for the fact that some other person might have the same issue i would keep this to myself .. i simply create a verticalfieldmanager that i add all the field to , then add that vfm to the screen . point in fact this should not make any difference - at all - as the default manager on a screen be a vfm. nothing else . no other property set , method call , event .. nada . go figure .
__label__anger	in netbeans , if i select some text and press , it work correctly and the text be indent to the right side as expect . but if i then try to backspace behind the text , it only remove #crd# space at a time . very annoying . be there any way to change this setting , so backspace behind a tab line cause the whole tab to be remove and not just space ?
__label__anger	i have a function : basically it just use the plugin to nudge an image on mouseover to #crd# slide and then another , to give the effect of a shake . i can see my code look absolutely horrible , ( i come from a php / c # background ) can anoyone suggest a good mean to achieve my goal ?
__label__anger	be there a way to create a batch api request with different access token to be use ? i need to crawl datum from youtube channel use the offline access token of our user but the problem be we have 0k of that and have request at a time be really painful and be take lot of time .
__label__anger	my form receive asynchronous callback from another object on random worker thread . i have be pass the datum to the main thread ( where it can be use to update onscreen control ) use delegate as show below . performance be dreadful -- once i reach update per #ord# , the program completely lock up . my gui processing itself be not the problem , as i can simulate this level of updating within the form and have no problem . be there a more efficient mechanism i should be use to hand off the datum from thread to thread ?
__label__anger	@mikechristensen that 's horrible 😐 and weird ! !
__label__anger	how do #crd# make m - ( the default behavior for type an opening " ( " character ? i want emacs to automatically insert the closing " ) " after the cursor when i type a " ( " character regardless of whether it 's part of an m - key combination . additionaly , i want to extend this behavior to quote , subquotes , bracket and brace . type m - ( be a pain , and there do not appear to be any comparable form for those other character .
__label__anger	back in the day i have to solve this with a panel where the text box be a component inside and have dockpadding set to or pixel . i would then style that panel to a single pixel . i always find this really annoying !
__label__anger	there 's some debate over that faq entry . yes , by all mean , answer your own question . but if you routinely have a set of pre-baked question and answer , then this site just become a blog , rather than an exchange . you have the misfortune of pick a day when someone abuse the spirit of that faq .
__label__anger	an example : extremely frustrating !
__label__anger	well , you could play around a bit … what about a function that rewrite itself ? warning : this be extremely ugly and should not be use in production code !
__label__anger	how i hate myserlf !
__label__anger	this seem fairly trivial but be give me hella grief ! i have a module in the lib folder . the controller . config / application . rb and i get this error i know the module be load correctly . what be i do wrong ?
__label__anger	the tumblr iphone app look awful -- both the gradient and the unnecessary boxed look impose by the gray border . stick to the standard uitableview look . what apple use for * their * app be what look most professional , not random novelty stuff .
__label__anger	index lookup in linkedlists be o (n) . that 'd could be terrible for a d array !
__label__anger	too bad it have not be update in year . and use the fetch / gclient be really painful
__label__anger	here 's a really terrible hack if you do not want the indirection and do not mind do the cleanup yourself :
__label__anger	i have a datagridview and need of context menu . when i right - click on cell ( red point ) - context menu show … but in wrong place . can not understand why here be the code : that stuff really annoy me !
__label__anger	this be a problem that regularly arise when i write silverlight xaml . in this case , i have make a usercontrol verticaltabstop ( code attach ) that have a tooltip attach . i instanciate a couple of my usercontrols , and then i get the debugging window and the follow error : i get an awful lot of these message as i hover my mouse over the button . any suggestion to what i be do wrong here ? cheer
__label__anger	still print but have that dread extra page ! 😐
__label__anger	if i can avoid it , no . and , to my knowledge , there be always a way to avoid it . but i be not state that it 's totally useless either
__label__anger	rmeader : if you have client who can barely restart their computer it be a pain . and from what i hear some version of window do not automatically synch time ..
__label__anger	in sublime text , if i press escape the page go into command mode , which seem to take text input as command , rather than actually type the text . another oddity be the visual mode , and i have no idea what it do besides it seem to highlight text . i think they come instal with the theme that i get , ' soda ' , maybe . anyway , i search and find out you can turn off command mode by press ' i ' . regardless , both of these mode be extremely annoying , how do i get rid of them ?
__label__anger	the problem be that you never run the method , so the field stay at #crd# . it 's a really terrible idea to give a field and a method the same name .
__label__anger	i be call onto some code that return me an http response . i can get the content of the response which return me a byte array . the byte represent a zip file that i would like to extract and get the content of a single file ( the zip only contain #crd# file ) . currently i have some messy code ( i will need to clean it up if i keep it ) that seem to work : but be wonder whether there be a clean way to do the same thing because the above look incredibly ugly .
__label__anger	#crd# thing i forget , make sure the dev database you be run the migration from ( the sql server database ) be update from production immediately before each test run . hate to have something fail on prod because you be test against outdated record .
__label__anger	the more i use updatepanels the more i hate them . i suggest you learn jquery or another javascript library and avoid use updatepanels all together .
__label__anger	@vascowhite i try delete all the product from the cm then add a new #crd# and the same message appear . really frustrating !
__label__anger	i have an asp:menu control that have #crd# different menu item in it . each menu item have a graphic and a text description . my problem be the icon and text have no padding between them and it just look ugly ! do anyone know how i can force a bit of padding between the image and text of the menu item ? i have look at all of the attribute on the asp:menu control , but i have not be able to find #crd# for this , but i may have just miss it .
__label__joy __label__anger	i discover the problem : i create my rail project with and have a model ' dream ' as well . rail be look at the application class instead of the model class . i get an error about dream already exist when i create the model and hand hack my way around that ( in retrospect , a horrible idea ) . this have be very frustrating but i have learn quite a bit !

__label__love	i be try to make a page where the user can input datum into #crd# different value in #crd# different text box , and the value can be store by use local storage , and then when the user refresh the page or open it in a new tab , those previously enter value be still there . any advice on how to do this would be really great ! here 's the code that i have currently :
__label__love	yeah it work fine 🙂 thanks ! !
__label__love	this sound like an excellent project ! you might want to start with the module . you might also be interested in the module . perhaps to get you start , here 's a function that take a path to a file and back the file up by copy it and give it a . bak extension .
__label__love	i be try to create a grid ( matrix ) of square in a give area with n column and m row , and an option to set a spacing between the square if desire . the grid should fill square with random coloring . i would also like to add a zoom function , so the colored square will appear much big in a region that be double - clicked . can anyone suggest a good method to generate the grid and assign random color to the square ? if you can suggest how to create the zoom effect too that would be super 🙂 i be new to canvas , so any method help would be great ! thanks

__label__love	@ryanc : excellent ! now i understand what be go on , rather than just thrashing , as before . i think your explanation ( about the canvas ignore ` refresh - now ` before it be open ) be very sensible . ( if any racket developer be listen here , it seem a valuable tool would be a way to pause until the frame be ready for action , platform - independent . )
__label__love	i be learn c ++ , then i be search for some code for learn something in the area that i love : file i / o , but i want to know how i can tweak my code for the user type the file that he want to see , like in wget , but with my program like this : the code of my program be here : thanks !

__label__love	wow , great link !
__label__love	i do a lot of vrml + java work in college and love it , but i feel like it 's not really a marketable skill . have anyone work with a high level graphic api like open inventor , coin .. etc that be actually in use to a degree that make invest a lot of time in the api worthwhile for something more than a hobby ?
__label__love	i be sure lot of people will say this by the time i have type this but … i know it 's not php but we be find just the job for this kind of thing . it really be an excellent piece of software .

__label__joy	personally , if you think you can do huge amount of refactoring , why not get the other student to come and sit with you and as you go , he / she can ask question and maybe he / she have some idea of their own . our industry move fast , as i be sure you know , so your partner wo not encounter other devs as forgive as you . i have add this as a comment because it do not actually answer your question about unit testing . just want to give you something else to think about . good luck !

__label__love __label__surprise	i agree with @rogeria . this do not explain why it be call the ioc and i be surprised by the number of up vote 😉
__label__sadness	if i delete this question will it increase my reputation ? down vote it really sad .
__label__sadness	@michael : dude , i feel your pain ( since my howto search lead me here ) .
__label__sadness	be it possible ( or desirable ? ! ) to set up to behave more like ? for example , instead of write why can not i just write similarly , instead of why not just
__label__sadness	i afraid here the relation between c0 and c0 in a single row could not be maintain ! ! !
__label__sadness	that be very very sad
__label__sadness	i should add that the element thing throw an error when it can not find something . do you normally use try / except for all find_element command ? * oh so very sad * ☹️
__label__sadness	you can set the document . domain but if i remember correctly a few browser ( opera ) will not even allow this . i be afraid your answer be to create some sort of proxy on the subdomain that you can talk through
__label__sadness	you could try this #crd# ( not optimal , i be afraid ) :
__label__sadness	that 's very sad ☹️
__label__sadness	i be not for sure how the controlcollection of asp . net work , so maybe someone can shed some light on this for me . i recently discover the magic that be extension method and linq . well , i be very sad to find that this be not valid syntax however from what i can tell , do implement the interface which provide such method , so what give ? why do not that just work ? i have find a decent work around for this issue at least :
__label__sadness	i have implement this in my visual studio addon visual installer as intellisense member completion . if you type variable followed by a period (.) a list of all possible member of this class be present in a list from which you can choose:second option be to move cursor over any class to view it 's members:see detail here : #hlink# sorry for this self promo - tlama be very angry for promote #ord# party software in inno question but there be no support for this in official inno setup editor and many people ask for this .
__label__sadness	i understand its not a desirable circumstance , however if i need to have some kind of html within json tag , e.g. : be this possible to do in python without require to to be escape beforehand ? it will be a string initially so i be think about write a regular expression to attempt to match and escape these prior to processing , but i just want to make sure there be not an easy way .
__label__sadness	a unit test should do the same thing every time that it run , otherwise you may run into a situation where the unit test only fail occasionally , and that could be a real pain to debug . try seed your pseudo-randomizer with the same seed every time ( in the test , that be -- not in production code ) . that way your test will generate the same set of input every time . if you can not control the seed and there be no way to prevent the function you be test from be randomize , then i guess you be stuck with an unpredictable unit test . ☹️
__label__sadness	i be completely horrible with javascript and jquery , how do i get the content from a php file ?
__label__sadness	#ord# of all i can not see object locking , unused lockobject variable make me sad . ienumerable be not special . each thread will have it 's own copy of reference to some instance of sektioner object . you can not affect other thread that way . what would happen with old version of datum point by sektioner field largely depend on call party .
__label__sadness	ah - make me look lazy ! ( guilty )
__label__love __label__anger	i agree with ceejayoz . talk about an absolutely horrible user experience .
