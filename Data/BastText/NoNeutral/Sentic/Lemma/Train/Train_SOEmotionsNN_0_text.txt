__label__sadness	i understand its not a desirable circumstance , however if i need to have some kind of html within json tag , e.g. : be this possible to do in python without require to to be escape beforehand ? it will be a string initially so i be think about write a regular expression to attempt to match and escape these prior to processing , but i just want to make sure there be not an easy way .
__label__anger	in vb . net you can , with the keyword ( i believe ) . but what you be try to do seem really horrible . just set them explicitly . it 's almost exactly the same amount of code .
__label__sadness	@almo @trojanfoe yes it be a horrible syntax error , sorry guy 's !
__label__love	love susy , so far ! now i would like this initial layout … to turn into this layout on a small screen : be this possible use susy ? furthermore , i would want the ac - column to function as a single entity when they be in the same column , since i would like to give them sticky behavior .
__label__love	i can not get any event trigger to work . a simplify example of what i be do be below - i know there be a event on border since it be define in but i be still get can not convert string ' mouseenter ' in attribute ' routedevent ' to object of type ' #hlink# ' as soon as i run the application . any help would be hugely appreciate .
__label__anger	this be not worthy of an " answer " , but i think i would mention : many of the interface i have really enjoy have be minimalistic -- there 's almost nothing for me to see . like quicksilver for os x.
__label__joy	if you be on 0g you be in luck 🙂 you can use select for update skip lock in the cursor - then you be guarantee that #crd# thread will never get the same row on a fetch ! the right way to do this in oracle would be advanced queueing - since this will solve all your problem , provide synchronization und parallel execution and other benefits….before oracle and without advanced queuing ( if you really want to code it yourself … ) you can do it like this :( the bit mark with autonomous transaction have to be call in a separate method as an autonomous transaction . if the update return row it can either be because the table be empty , or because #crd# thread access the same row . - so we need a separate end condition count available row .
__label__anger	be there a way to have mod_wsgi reload all module ( maybe in a particular directory ) on each load ? while work on the code , it 's very annoying to restart apache every time something be change . the only option i have find so far be to put below every import … but that 's also really annoying since it mean i be go to have to go through and remove them all at a late date …

__label__love	almost work . you have to seek to #crd# less then write a byte , otherwise you still end up with a 0b file . still very helpful , thanks ! correct syntax too . if you want to edit , the extra line you need be outfile . writebyte ( ) ;
__label__anger	extremely lousy solution .
__label__fear	to be honest i do not even know where to start . i guess the solution might entail use a zillion iif statement . i be fairly new to this i be afraid !
__label__love	awesome ! thanks .

__label__love	i absolutely * love * your title ! but your question will need some more detail if you need some help . do you have any code you have try ?
__label__love	i really love anonymous inner class …
__label__anger	this will compile a regular expression that match #crd# or more this open the file locate at for reading , assign the subsequent file object to the variable the function of file object return a list of the line of the object . it be exactly identical to on system that use as a newline . ( windows typically use ) this split the #ord# element of ( ) include everything but the last element ( ) on the regex you define early ( that , again , catch all - > ) note that this be really awful code . there 's no reason to use a regex here , and use when you be only look for the #ord# line be kind of like build an engine so you know what the spark plug look like . this be good :
__label__fear	i be write an eclipse plugin for the jdt. i need a functionality that track certain string or regular expression and possibly create marker . i know that eclipse already do that for // todo comment , for example ( create task marker for them ) but i be not sure if i can use the same mechanism . i can write my own but worry it would be too inefficient and not sensitive enough to code chnanges .
__label__sadness	that be really sad ☹️
__label__anger	ended up be a bad dependency . i have to add it manually to get it all work . terrible !
__label__joy	well , i be use the setcontrolvaluetouppercase ( ) method too soon it seem . so change my keydown #ord# if statement to fix my issue . horray me ! !
__label__joy	sure , you can . just mark your content with the appropriate langauge code : if you use the follow css , the spanish text be format with the most - love font style comic sans m : easy !

__label__sadness	this probably sound really stupid but i have noo idea how to implement jquery 's rounded corner ( ) . my javascript - fu be complete fail and i can not seem to get it to work on my page . can anyone show me a simple example of the html and javascript you would use to get them to show ? apology for my idiocy .
__label__love	excellent ! it work , thank you very much .
__label__love	awesome , thanks !
__label__anger	i can not help think that make xml ad xmllist both unrelated , as in both extend object directly , be a design flaw in the as0 core library . surely have xml extend xmllist would be a much clean system , where xml be consider an xmllist with only #crd# member ? this would also avoid the very annoying practice of an e0x query possibly return either an xml or xmllist , which can result in a casting error . so be there any reason i be not think of that xml and xmllist be design to only have object as a common type ?
__label__love	if your memory consideration be only about these integer , then all i say be woooow 🙂
__label__anger	i hate be that guy , but this be really not the way to do whatever you aretrying to do

__label__anger	i be work with eclipse ( indigo ) to develop c project . when i create a new c project in a new workspace , by default the " autosave before build " option be not set . this be extremely frustrating , as autosave be usually the default behavior in other ide 's i work on . i change some code , build and nothing seem to go as expect - until i remember that the option be not set … be there a way to make eclipse open a new workspace with this option set ?
__label__love	this be really great , work a treat thanks
__label__joy	few thing to make this work : your classname file should start with a capital letter , your config array must be define as $ config = array ( ) ( and not $ var or any other name ) , your config file must be lowercase . the config file be pass through the constructor , so class ( $ config = array ( )) , you can then access and store the config variable on an instance variable . hope it help : config file : good luck 🙂
__label__love	@ryanc : excellent ! now i understand what be go on , rather than just thrashing , as before . i think your explanation ( about the canvas ignore ` refresh - now ` before it be open ) be very sensible . ( if any racket developer be listen here , it seem a valuable tool would be a way to pause until the frame be ready for action , platform - independent . )
__label__love	great thanks fung ! it be especially the " start our debugging session " section that help .
__label__joy	ah , excellent ! 🙂

__label__sadness	i be sorry to say this but most silverlight grid do not support cell merging . at least not out of the box . i have resort to use component #crd# studio for silverlight in order to achieve this , and even then it have not be exactly a walk in the park . consider c0 data grid control . here be a sample on with sample code and a small write up . the down side of such solution be that c0's control be extremely expensive ☹️ i wish micro$oft come up with some enhancement in sl0 that would accommodate for such issue .
__label__anger	can i fix the width and the height of jquerymobile dialog ? currently , the size of width be % which be really awful in ipad .
__label__anger	so i have also run into this problem . i have find a solution ( it 's terrible , be warn ! ) open unity and load your solution in monodevelop ( old version you can set the target framework more easily ) navigate to your project directory and open " assembly - csharp - vs " in notepad . change the line " targetframeworkversion " v0 to " targetframeworkversion " v0 you will have to do these step every time you load unity ( blah ) but it do work .

__label__sadness	if i delete this question will it increase my reputation ? down vote it really sad .
__label__anger	i be nearly reach rage mode ! can anyone help me with this ? ? i set a limit on a codeigniter model so i can only that set of result . why be it not work ? the record be display correctly on function call , but i be get more than how it 's suppose to

__label__anger	base mostly on , but also , and my own experience , i do not think it 's possible without a lot of ugliness , pain or without convert your linq to sql code generation over to ( not appealing , imo ) .
__label__sadness	a ( it do not have to be a class ; structs and interface can be partial too ) be basically a single type which have its code spread across multiple file . the main use for this be to allow a code generator ( e.g. a visual studio designer ) to " own " #crd# file , while hand - write code be put in another . i have no idea whether python / perl have the same capability , i be afraid .
__label__love	i be read about the callcontext class ( ) . the documentation say something about " logical thread " and " thread local storage " . what 's a logical thread , i do not know that there existed multiple kind of thread ? what 's a thread local storage , be it a class or a principle of some kind ? i have not be able to find it in on msdn , but i be sure it be there some place , so any link would be great 🙂
__label__anger	hi all i have a horrid database i get ta work with and linq to sql be the option im take to retrieve datum from . anywho im try to reuse a function by throw in a different table name base on a user selection and there be no way to my knowledge to modify the tentity or table < > in a datacontext query . this be my current code . i want to populate my viewdata with enumerable record .

__label__love	kudos , great question !
__label__love	there be several article on the internet about develop elevate process in vista , but essentially elevation request involve decorate . net assembly and win0 executables with elevation status in the application manifest file ( may be embed or side - by - side ) . there be an excellent blog post about your question which provide the code you will probably need :

__label__love	excellent ! that make life considerably easy . i really do not want to add another layer to the application if i could avoid it . as far as stackoverflow etiquette go , if i set this question as answer , nikos wo not get the rep for it as the answer be in the comment . what 's the protocol ?

__label__sadness	be pack - decimal part of the ebcdic format , or be this just a file which happen to use both ? i be not familiar with that format , i be afraid ☹️
__label__anger	my guess would be from a colleague who want to scare this person out of ever use ' this ' again . it can be fairly annoying when someone use ' this ' for every single thing they do . not that it justify lie to a new programmer , but i can imagine someone do this out of frustration .
__label__sadness	the current solution i implement be awful ! i use a for insert record from an ado . net data - table into an sql table . i would like to insert at once the data - table into the sql table , without iterate … be that possible , or be i ask too much ?
__label__anger	i be suffer from the problem in the #ord# example - my enums do not show up at all . this answer do not even attempt to address that issue .

__label__fear	it sound very scary to me to use a floating point number for a key in a ` map ` .
__label__anger	the question on how to check input for validity be answer numerous time ! you just check whether the stream be in a good state . if not , you will reset the stream and ignore the character . search for question where this answer . also , do not use exception for non-exceptional case and * always * throw something derive from ` std::exception ` : once you have try to locate where an exception come from which be not derive from ` std::exception ` in a program with a few #crd# line of code you will find it extremely helpful to look at what ` what ( ) ` return !

__label__anger	instead of load everything which be neither possible nor really desirable i would use a slide window instead - when you reach a certain maximum list size ( say i.e. item ) you automatically remove the top item when you add the next item to the bottom . if you scroll just right after the update this should not even be noticeable by your user .

__label__anger	if you can edit the code , you should just re-write it to use a custom api that do what you want . fail that , use maximilian 's technique , but be warn that it be a maintenance horror . if you can not edit the code , you can patch the import table to redirect call to your own code . a description of this technique can be find in - search for the section title " spy by alter of the import address table " . this be dangerous , but if you be careful you can make it work . also check out , which do the same sort of thing but do not require you to mess around with the actual patching .

__label__love	i love the visualization of the race . well do .
__label__love	you can easily define a comparator for a #crd# - level , so that lookup become way less cumbersome . there be no reason of be afraid of that . the comparator define an ordering of the _ key template argument of the map . it can then also be use for the multimap and set collection . an example :
__label__love	i always recommend for a good starting point for beginner - especially those who have see sql but never understand how to build up a query them self or how they work . all celko 's book be great . hernandez 's mere mortal book be good . ken henderson 's book be also excellent .

__label__love	excellent question . run a large project in successive version of python would not be very definitive , unless you have , say , unit test that magically achieve % code coverage , so a tool like this would be nice to have .
__label__joy	code contract be pretty cool , but they do have some limitation . they will only create compiler warning , not error . also , this analysis be pretty slow on large project . however , i be hope this technology will evolve and eventually be integrate into the language itself . it 's incredibly promising !
__label__love	excellent answer to a very general question ! 🙂

__label__joy	hopefully this will provide some idea as to how to adapt a timer base approach for your need : if your need be more sophisticated then a tthread base approach may be more appropriate . but whatever you do , do not resort to application . processmessages it will only cause you grief !

__label__joy	i be just get my foot wet with multiprocessing ( and its totally awesome ! ) , but i be wonder if there be any guideline to select number of process ? be it just base on number of core on the server ? be it somehow base on the application your running ( number of loop , how much cpu it use , etc ) ? etc….how do i decide how many process to spawn ? right now , i be just guess and add / remove process but it would be great if there be some kind of guideline or good practice . another question , i know what happen if i add too few ( program be slooow ) but what if i add ' too many ' ? thanks !

__label__anger	unfortunately the smbios uuid be not unique on all system . it should be but it be not . this be not because of a failure in the specification of the smbios uuid , but be due to the fact that many manufacturer do not follow the spec when create this uuid . for more information about how this go wrong in practice see this intel blog and the follow instructive tale have some really awful example from the real world : . by the way there be another more informative topic on stackoverflow about create machine unique id 's at

__label__joy	there be a few plugins which you could look at for that functionality , if not flat - out use : good luck , hope these help !
__label__anger	they sure do not @michaelszyndel . it 's extremely frustrating . i be use the late ver , too . i really would like to get it work properly .
__label__love	the be an excellent resource for locale datum . from the website you can download an xml version of the database , which include datetime format , number format , and lot of other locale specific datum .
__label__anger	double be not compare that way in real life …
__label__joy	you can try the ( very ) comprehensive jeff 's or go with this simple workaround : and then declare the attribute as an integer : this work very fine for me ! 😃
__label__love	excellent ! it work like this : [ code ] extern " c " {
__label__love	@marc - andrã© lafortune your answer there be incredibly helpful ! thank you !
__label__love	mike , totally agree . i really like the idea of silverlight , its tie with visual studio be really awesome , but it have quite a way to go before it be mature enough for primetime use .
__label__joy	in the absence of tuples , they be sometimes the clean way to do thing . i generally hate them , though . f # have some nice syntactical sugar for deal with them . rather than make me deal with parameter , it treat them as method that return tuples instead . the various method end up return #crd# element tuples : it 's quite handy , and do not make me feel dirty .
__label__surprise	i do not know that . i always think it be and .
__label__love	we could , but that would mean instal wsdl0ruby and so on and so forth . sometimes dog slow be fine 🙂
__label__anger	damn .. that s what i be afraid of ! !

__label__love	svg transform on text attribute work excellent ! this snippet , for example , will increase your text by 0x at y - axis .
__label__love	upvote , excellent explanation !
__label__anger	my approach to this problem would be : create a that host a add a dependency property to the . in the event handler , parse the csv and update the accordingly . add a dependency property to the - and when this change , parse the csv and add the datum to the . see this question for a few pointer : by the way , a csv of column name be a horrible interface ! why not expose a , then add a so that you can use a csv string in xaml ?
__label__joy	yes , it 's possible , juste remove the #ord# parameter of your method ( it 's totally useless ) an it will work ( i test the code ) !
__label__joy	i have no clue if this approach would be feasible or not , but then there be #crd# thing you could try : #hlink# a singleton class where you and the arraylist . the class might look like this : to access the list you could write : be the name of the getter method and before get it set it . else you might get . also a receiver might start before the list be fill . so always check for null before you use #hlink# other option be you store the list in a cache object like check for even in this case in the broadcast receiver before use it . hope that help !
__label__love	@kunalk : excellent ! work for me . if you put this as answer then i can accept it . and it will helpful in future .
__label__anger	believe me without an ide you just waste your time and it be a real pain ! if you feel that visual studio be expensive you can try the or go for or
__label__sadness	well … taht 's … sad ☹️
__label__love __label__joy	upvote for both the answer and the comment . priceless 🙂
__label__love	i understand not like xaml , as it really intimidate me at #ord# , but i will quickly say that it be a powerful tool . i be not sure how to do it through the designer , but in c # let 's say you name your datagrid ' mydatagrid ' and your list be name ' stringlist ' . it be as simple as the follow : and the datum grid be now bind to your string list .
__label__anger	vineet , what you be try to do be a terrible idea ! if you ever find yourself have to engineer something as fundamental as that , take a step back and work out what else do it ! i do not really believe in the whole spoon feed so thing , but what mtwebster say be on the right track !
__label__surprise	project ! wow ! well i can see that happen for what you do …
__label__anger	ahh get it . you do not downvote me for simply ask you to explain a bit more do you ?
__label__love __label__joy	as thing be evolve very fast , there be some major update . for example , a framework name total . j have make much work to make angular . js work in hand with node . js . please have a look at their web site and at the (!) example they provide on how to use it : . pretty amazing ! hope that help ! note : i have no affiliation with total . j at all .

__label__sadness	my experience with soap be not good ) : and documentation ( at least in d0 ) be extremely poor !
__label__sadness	i have forget to put the code tag around it and everything be garbled and the formatting be terrible for about the #ord# #ord# of life . apologize to those who click quickly and see the garbage .
__label__sadness	i just get through this exact problem . what a pain ! if you be run a - bit jvm on a - bit window , make sure that you set the execution policy for the - bit powershell interface . i find my bit executable here : the - and - bit powershell environment be completely distinct so set the execution policy in #crd# have no effect on the other .
__label__anger	here be an incredibly disgusting way to do it : here be a good way ( i think ) : if you convert either output string with : you get your original number .
__label__love	i be relatively new to angularjs and be love every moment of it ! i have an unordered list of product . when the user hover over them , i need the list element to have an class set on them . i be currently do it this way : and my showdetails be as follow : now , everything be work just fine , however , i be wonder if it be possible to set the class without the ng - repeat and have no variable to bind to ? how should i write my showdetails function to set the class this time ? my #ord# try be : but what do i do in the ng - class attribute ?
__label__joy __label__anger	as point out in the comment , you can read argument from the cmd line in the args area of the main method , for example : when run this with : it write out the name of the file . hope this help !
__label__joy	old question , i know , but i find it while search for a similar answer . unless the api have change , the reason why harpo 's answer be not work be because be an instance method , not a static method . but fear not -- there 's an instance of present in each instance of -- the property . so in your case , if you be within a controller ( or , i suspect , a view ) : that should do the trick !
__label__anger	my form receive asynchronous callback from another object on random worker thread . i have be pass the datum to the main thread ( where it can be use to update onscreen control ) use delegate as show below . performance be dreadful -- once i reach update per #ord# , the program completely lock up . my gui processing itself be not the problem , as i can simulate this level of updating within the form and have no problem . be there a more efficient mechanism i should be use to hand off the datum from thread to thread ?
__label__anger	i really hate that object …
__label__anger	yes another reason to hate ie !
__label__love	excellent ! thank you so much for the thorough explanation , and for provide the demo . so ` eval ( ) ` allow you to access the value store in each variable . this be handy if you want the name of your variable to itself be store in a variable . handy ! you do an excellent job explain . gold star for you . 🙂
__label__love	have you actually implement this successfully ? it sound like a great solution !
__label__anger	everything in the terminal buffer . command history be easy , just ' history ' . sometimes there 's an exception or a log i want to grab , but it go off the screen or select - all be a pain . i want to make a cmd line tool that do it and maybe send it to a new gist .

__label__joy	this be simple i hope 🙂 when i create a new web application in wss do it need to be on port if i want to point an external domain name at it ? everything be standard in term of iis and port that be open i.e. port be the only #crd# open . i be guess if i let wss assign a port number to the new web application surely this can never be access externally unless i open the assign port ? cheer

__label__anger	i have do some easy . hover ( function ( ) statement in jquery . when i hover over a text i simply want a # div . fadein , and on non-hover fadeout . it work . but it 's just if i spam the text - trigger with hover and un-hoverring really quickly and then stop the animation begin to give a blink effect . it just kind of loop , really annoying !

__label__love	i have a long scrolling page , and want to test if an element be 0px from the top , then apply a class elsewhere ( until the next element in line be 0px from the top ) if i could just get the basic statement i would be ecstatic , anything extra would be a bonus !
__label__anger	so , the follow hack seem to work , but it 's really incredibly ugly imo , as it rely on you control the line - height and use absolute positioning . bad , it require you to know how many line there be in your text , which depend on the width of the div and the font - size , and probably require js to compute . anyway , after all the above disclaimer , here 's the hack : use #crd# divs with the same text , #crd# on top of the other . #crd# justify , #crd# center . then clip the justify #crd# . html css fiddle . of course , the above code be hard - code for the specific width . again , you will probably need js in order to compute the number of line in the div. i be pretty sure that until this get implement in webkit you probably wo not find an elegant solution for your problem .

__label__sadness	a unit test should do the same thing every time that it run , otherwise you may run into a situation where the unit test only fail occasionally , and that could be a real pain to debug . try seed your pseudo-randomizer with the same seed every time ( in the test , that be -- not in production code ) . that way your test will generate the same set of input every time . if you can not control the seed and there be no way to prevent the function you be test from be randomize , then i guess you be stuck with an unpredictable unit test . ☹️

__label__anger	with no offense , just as #crd# developer to another , i be afraid that your idea seem terribly inefficient . it seem to me that instead of unite sqlite database you should probably be store several table within the same database file . however if i be mistaken i guess you could attach the database and then use a view to simplify your query . or make an in-memory table and copy over all the datum ( but that 's even bad performance wise , especially if you have large database )
__label__anger	alan , i assume some people already hate you just for ask . and they have a point .

__label__anger	there 's always the poor man 's alternative of just load a bajillion individual frame as . gif / jpg / png and have javascript display them in sequence . it would be absolutely horrible for bandwidth and memory usage , and of course no audio , but it would ( somewhat ) simulate video be play . of course , on windows platform , you could use activex and / or embed medium player and play avi / wmv file as well , without ever touch flash .

__label__love	ryan oberoi make an excellent suggestion , but it 's a bit overkill for my small asp . net mvc web application . i like lobstrosity 's idea since it could apply to any class tag and its short and simple … just what i need . both be good answer yet #crd# solve the general question ( involve a css framework ) and the other #crd# solve my specific need … i guess i should select ryan 's response as the solution as it would probably help other more … any suggestion ?
__label__anger	i personally only use the ' m ' and the ' p ' . the rest be just zany in my view . it make the code so darn hard to decipher . i do maintenance work on this guy 's code who use semi-hungarian notation type id prefix on every variable , function , and other identifier in the code . he use $ sign liberally to separate word . it be hard to keep the murderous rage in check .

__label__joy	i have a table with a field that need to store character . my question be this : can you limit the length of a text field ( varchar stop at - i can not use it ) to character ? if i do that , will mysql run through the table quick due to the fix datum length , or do it act a bit like varchar in that the length can vary ? i do not have a table ( at all ) yet , but i be very conscious about speed and size for the future . i find this article : incredibly useful - maybe you will to ! thanks a lot , james

__label__love	i really like kate , and since it 's a kpart , other kde program use it as the editor , so it 's goodness everywhere ! ( why be everybody else assume you use window ? )
__label__anger	as alexander say , you be compare a string and a char . the sad thing be that the compiler already tell you that , only it encrypt it in iso-stl - template encryption , which be more difficult to read that perl ! you may want to look at for decrypt c ++ stl error message .
__label__sadness	oh . that 's really sad . so it would be only plane menu option with white background. , be it ?

__label__anger	be not an , it 's a basic type . you can only add nsobject - derive object to an nsarray . the exc_bad_access be probably because , under the cover , it 's try to access an object store at wherever your int be point to . in other word , it 's use your int as a pointer to an nsobject and fail horribly when it do so .
__label__love	work excellent , many thanks !

__label__anger	it be really painfull to get all code form tfs whenever you make a build use nant . be there any setting in ccnet . config which will only take the file which be change form last time which can speed up the process .
__label__love	if / when you figure this out - you definitely need to share it back to the world … i would love something like this !
__label__love	that look like an excellent technique and pretty much negate my question ! 🙂
__label__anger	yes definately turn off that solution wide processing . it 's a hog .
__label__love	excellent suggestion aleksey ! this seem to be a common need , so perhaps the scala god might consider add this to map
__label__joy	use if - else inside scriplet base on the currently select language and place appropriate " td " tag . hope this be what you be look for !

__label__love	@jball : upvote this be an example of the way ` . live ( ) ` be painfully abuse .
__label__love	@guffa : a * very * excellent question . there 's not typically a good reason to do so .
__label__sadness	that _ be _ sad news
__label__joy	@joe yes , if i be to declare the property and synthesize it as above , but i do not explicitly declare an ivar myself , the compiler will still actually create the ivar . so i could do ` int len = [ self . stringproperty length ] ` as you would expect inside the class , and i can also do ` int len = [ stringproperty length ] ` as well , without use the accessor method , just directly use the ivar ( which the compiler have synthesize for me , along with setter + getter ) . it 's really fantastic !
__label__joy	i hope fortune favor the brave 🙂
__label__sadness	list comprehension performance link be dead ☹️
__label__love	gosh ! you be right ! ! ! excellent ! ! ! ! be there a way to expand it programatically ? i add . setongoing ( true ) ( to the top ) but it 's not expand … ( not really the top because the #ord# #crd# be a notification when i be plug to usb for tool developpement ) . thank you again my friend !
__label__anger	how be a question about host less programming related than this which get plenty of up vote #hlink#

__label__joy	it 's a progress bar ! 🙂 setting make it a rotating circle rather than a classic progress bar . there be several different style you can use . play around with them to find the #crd# you like 🙂 hope this help !
__label__love	so i be try to write a rr rotation and ll rotation with java for an avl tree . i have most of it figure out , however i do not know where i should modify the height within the method . i have be try to understand it for a few day here but i can not figure out where exactly it would go in the method i currently have . if someone could help explain exactly where i should put the modification for the height of the node ( it use getleft / setleft for it 's left height and getright / setright for it 's right height ) it would be extremely helpful !
__label__anger	i completely disagree with the answer so far . i feel that internal be a horrid idea , prevent another assembly from inherit your type , or even use your internal type should the need for a workaround come about . today , i have to use reflection in order to get to the internals of a #hlink# ( i have to build a datatable lightning fast , without all of its check ) , and i have to use reflection , since not a single type be available to me ; they be all mark as internal .
__label__love	@r … , excellent reading , many thanks ! 😃

__label__joy	very annoying , but simply solve ! reason be that by write you tell ruby : i be give a block to this method call … and that 's obviously not what you want . simple fix : just add parenthesis to your method call :

__label__joy	great question ! i also find myself a little lose in wpf because of the amount of flexibility it offer and have be look for guidance in how to choose font , layout , spacing , color , etc. i have have a hard time find book or website to improve my ui design skill , so i hope we find great answer here !
__label__anger	imho multi-core processor be still so rare , and threading be such a horrible and hairy and dangerous place to go , that you be just good off stick to #crd# thread .
__label__fear	i be afraid you can not fetch that ! the graph api do not provide any api to do so .
__label__joy	wpf be a fascinating platform to develop our next generation application on ! the ability to style just about anything , the databinding support and attach / dependency property . wow ! but let 's not throw caution to the wind because while wpf performance be great , it 's not the good … yet . definitely be a strong contender , but as developer we be still leave with design principle for our front end .

__label__anger	i have an asp:menu control that have #crd# different menu item in it . each menu item have a graphic and a text description . my problem be the icon and text have no padding between them and it just look ugly ! do anyone know how i can force a bit of padding between the image and text of the menu item ? i have look at all of the attribute on the asp:menu control , but i have not be able to find #crd# for this , but i may have just miss it .

__label__anger	too bad this behavior be not a setting . i think it make sense in theory why they do it this way , but in practice it 's just really annoying
__label__joy	so through an incredibly awesome coding session i manage to extract all the variable on the #ord# try . well , all check out except for array since the pdf i test on do not have #crd# in the aux info . all the datum from cgpdfdictionaryref be now in an nsmutabledictionary , so its usable . tomorrow i will be make the #ord# part to put it back into the other type that be need , cfdictionaryref . so if you want to wait i will post it up .

__label__joy	take a look at this , and rejoice ! 🙂
__label__love	i be sure lot of people will say this by the time i have type this but … i know it 's not php but we be find just the job for this kind of thing . it really be an excellent piece of software .
__label__anger	free the local array " buffer " be undefined , and probably horrible , behavior ! you can not free something unless it be allocate with malloc ( ) or calloc ( ) . it 's likely corrupt the heap and cause the crash .
__label__anger	yes , we use to use starling . but it 's a pain to always delegate the stuff that could take awhile to a different process .
__label__sadness	i be afraid i can not entirely follow your question - do you want to have a sign up form for membership or email notification show as an article ? if so , then the easy way be to install ' m0c ' - the ' module to component ' component . then you can put any module ( ie the sign up box ) in the centre content area . the m0c component can be find here :
__label__anger	i have a screen with say control on it . i want to show all #crd# , then hide only the #crd# that do not relate to what i be work on . my problem be that between the loop the screen paint . it look very ugly . i know i have see this do but for the life of me i can not find that code , or even remember what app i would see that code in … do anyone know how to suspend the paint for a bit ?
__label__love	@nathansmith great success ! if you submit that as an answer instead of a comment , i will accept it !

__label__love	in my database i have these #crd# table ( project and theme ) . i also have a middle table call project_theme which contain projectid and theme . in theme there be about value pre-setted . i be able to display all these theme into checkboxes however i do not know how to save them in my database . here be my controller : here be my model : and my #ord# model : finally here be my create view : so please if there be anyone that could help me , it would be really great 🙂
__label__joy	if it would not have be a programming question , the answer of your title would be priceless 🙂
__label__surprise	that 's what i think , that 's why i be surprised
__label__anger	you be process the newline character as if it be legitimate input . you should either read the entire line ( include the newline , perhaps use a ) and then process the #ord# character of the line or simply add a test to skip newlines in your loop logic.p.s . convert case by add or subtract be a really awful approach . it wo not work with anything but a-z and a-z ( in the english alphabet ) . it wo not work for most character outside the basic latin block and should not be use at all for character that have no alternate case ( such as newline ) . you should be use and instead .
__label__love	excellent , thank you ! i do not know when we be go to upgrade but that 's a good reason to i guess .
__label__love	excellent advice , thanks !
__label__love	excellent , thanks very much !

__label__love	i be wonder how boxcar work , anybody know ? i know how to do the push notification from server to iphone , but i have no clue of how to create the server to get the @reply and dm from twitter in real time . any suggestion on what i should look into to create the server ? should i use twitter 's stream api or user stream api ? any sample code , in php preferably , will be great 🙂 thanks !

__label__love	phpexcel , so you do write that library . excellent ! for now max entry of csv be for a test . maybe i lurk around with it if you introduce how to do that ? thanks
__label__joy	press ctrl + c and keep on processng ctrl. query be kill for me … 🙂 ubuntu
__label__love	you be right . see my update ! make a suggestion pls and i will catch your thought 😉
__label__anger	part of the reason why this be " dog slow " be that you be build the proxy every time you connect to the service . you could avoid this pain by use wsdl0ruby to build the proxy permanently and then call the pre-generated proxy .
__label__anger	i be work in vb . net and have a class , foo , that implement an interface , ibar . i have a list of foo 's , but i need to pass a list of ibar 's into a function , but i keep get cast error , even when i use directcast . my code be in both main and main0 i get mainworks work , but it would be really annoying and inefficient to have to do that everywhere i want to call this function .
__label__joy	i have just check that simply add the font to the vs project 's font folder be enough and be worried that i would have to manually make these call . fortunately , the vs project have a register = vsdrffont property , so i be go to assume that the installer do this automatically .
__label__joy	just use rotateflip : as @dan - o have point out , this allow a rotation of any of the degree 's in the enum . to rotate a bitmap any angle without lose the size , you could do the follow , but it 's a bit convoluted ! #crd# - add the library to your project #crd# - add the xaml , windowsbase and presentationcore library to your project #crd# - use the follow to rotate your bitmap any amount of degree : pain in the ass , but work !
__label__anger	ok this be really annoying , can not find a solution that work !
__label__surprise	i have do some research for " the bast way to insert huge datum into db with c # " then a lot of people just suggest me use sqlbulkcopy . after i try it out and it really amaze me . undoubtedly , sqlbulkcopy be very very fast . it seem that sqlbulkcopy be a perfect way to insert datum ( especially huge datum ) . but why do nt we use it at all time . be there any drawback of use sqlbulkcopy ?
__label__love	upvote that look like an excellent resource !
__label__anger	shortcut key often do not work the same way across all browser . and they be awful on opera . and most user wo not use them . the only thing i would bother with on most site be button for next and prev , and i would also make the alt tag say " next " or " previous " to assist browser with fast forward .
__label__anger	what exactly be not work ? itâ$™s hard to guess â$¦ you shouldnâ$™t be use erigi to check for a substring : ) itâ$™s deprecated ) use instead . edit : your code scream sql injection !
__label__anger	put datum in the id be a terrible , terrible idea .
__label__anger	i have a big problem . i have create site , use jquery , but it run very slowly . on mobile phone it 's terrible ! and i do not know , what 's wrong … someone can help me ? link do not work yet , because i want use cms on this layout , but before i want to little optimise these script . here 's test site : and here be the script :
__label__fear	_ automagically _ append datum to ` ~ / . ssh / authorized_keys ` sound scary !
__label__love	i be try to make a page where the user can input datum into #crd# different value in #crd# different text box , and the value can be store by use local storage , and then when the user refresh the page or open it in a new tab , those previously enter value be still there . any advice on how to do this would be really great ! here 's the code that i have currently :
__label__anger	anti-javascript snobbery ! every language use a separate platform on some level to parse and execute the code . javascript be just another language , capable of write " program " or " script " .
__label__love	excellent ! ! ! this be exactly what i be look for !
__label__anger	no beta involve , the lack of repro be really annoy me !

__label__fear	i have a page run on my local django dev server with the django debug toolbar that seem to be run quite slowly but i be unsure why : django debug toolbar say sql - query in m and then run a profiler i get function call ( primitive call ) in #ord# so i be left wonder why be the profile time so much low than the total cpu time ? and then how can i find out what 's cause the difference ? and secondary to that - should i be worried about the involuntary context switch ! ?
__label__joy	i #ord# try to put the whole path instead . for relative path , if you be do compile and run in command line / terminal , you need to have that studentrecords . txt in the same directory of your code file . if you be use an ide , you need to put your studentrecords . txt under the src / folder . this be assume you be not in maven project setup ; otherwise it should be put under / src / main / java / resource / . hope this help !
__label__sadness	i should add that the element thing throw an error when it can not find something . do you normally use try / except for all find_element command ? * oh so very sad * ☹️
__label__anger	this be how you find the arc length give the parameter , but find equidistant point require the inverse of this function . get from #crd# to the other be not trivial . @christian romo : how do you do it ? i mean , you can just use binary search , but that would be horribly slow ( for what i be try to do , anyway ) .

__label__love	i be pretty familiar with pgp , and the way it work . i would like to include some functionality in a project , but so far my research have leave my head spin . what i would like to do be create a public key with a define private pass phrase . from there , i would share the public key with someone where they can then encrypt a message use the key and return it to me where i can decrypt . i envision the code look something like this . to generate my private pgp key : to encrypt i would give my share key to a friend : to decrypt the encrypted string after be send back to me : obviously i know i be skip out on a ton of detail . through my research i have see reference to library like bouncy castle and spongy castle . any help would be hugely appreciate !
__label__joy	ah , #crd# be a much less scary number !
__label__love	this will answer your question : good luck !
__label__joy	@catsby be correct -- you will want to use the to do this . sidenote : heroku 's platform api be actually incredibly awesome . you can use it to scale dynos , set variable , provision / deprovision addons , etc.

__label__sadness	#ord# of all i can not see object locking , unused lockobject variable make me sad . ienumerable be not special . each thread will have it 's own copy of reference to some instance of sektioner object . you can not affect other thread that way . what would happen with old version of datum point by sektioner field largely depend on call party .

__label__anger	whatever you do , make sure that you do not use apache 's dbcp. it 's a horrible implementation that will actually cause performance problem , not fix them .
__label__anger	why use a ` mutex ` here ? the ` acquire ` method just return a reference to an instance ( this be a reference type ) . whether the object reference be mutable or immutable be irrelevant . the reference be to the same object no matter if the object mutate . why do locking ? even if the instance be not " singleton " or " read - only " , i.e. even if the field reference could change , since [ reference assignment be atomic ] ( #hlink# there would still be no need for locking / `mutex ` . i will downvote this answer @ net upvotes …
__label__fear	a colleague recently ask me how to deep - clone a map and i realize that i probably have never use the clone ( ) method - which worry me . what be the most common scenario you have find where you need to clone an object ?
__label__joy	would you happen to have another column in your table where you can group them as " " , " " , etc ? it would look something like this: st column | #ord# columna | 0b | 0c | d | 0a | 0b | 0c | d | 0if you order it by #ord# column , it will return . but since you have another column , you can do order by st column , #ord# column , and it will be #hlink# ia ofcourse assume that you have a field like st column . but give that you be look at have them order like , there must be something in your other field that can help you achieve that hope this help !
__label__love	so i need to get a quotient to decimal place like , but do i need to use double all the way down or can i use integer for everything except the quotient and then just use double or decimal for the quotient ? it be also break because of the quotient . if anyone could help me i would be extremely grateful 🙂

' you should your design ..
__label__anger	the answer do not establish the same 's as add directly to the ajax call . so in order for jquery to do this properly i add this : where be a global variable . unfortunately , i have to write this extra line on every single ajax call . terrible ! maybe i will edit the jquery framework to handle this …
__label__fear	in my mental model of authentication , a user should be distinct from the way they log in. so for example , a user could have an associate emaillogin ( with an email / password ) , or they could have many ( or none ) . similarly they could have …* associate openidlogin credential . be there any exist authentication library for rail which use this method ? alternatively , be this a really terrible idea ?

__label__anger	@rob same problem , nothing . very disgusting
__label__anger	write a stream manipulator be a very complicated way of do something very simple !
__label__anger	index lookup in linkedlists be o (n) . that 'd could be terrible for a d array !
__label__joy	agree that you should ensure that your datum be properly index . apart from that , if you be worried about table size , you can always implement some type of datum archival strategy to later down the line . do not worry too much about this until you see problem crop up , and do not optimise prematurely .
__label__love	work great ! and you can add " desc " after the end to sort in other direction . in which case the string will show #ord# . i like how this solution do nt actually pad the number in the result output .

__label__love	that thing be really really awesome !
__label__love __label__joy	excellent ! thank you for your perseverence 🙂
__label__anger	there 's some debate over that faq entry . yes , by all mean , answer your own question . but if you routinely have a set of pre-baked question and answer , then this site just become a blog , rather than an exchange . you have the misfortune of pick a day when someone abuse the spirit of that faq .

__label__joy	i be wonder if its possible to join together ienumerable 's . basically i have a bunch of user and need to get their content from the database so i can search and page through it . i be use linq to sql , my code at the moment it : i hope that make some sense ! matt
__label__anger	i have a method that do a bunch of thing ; amongst them do a number of insert and update . it 's declare thusly … it work exactly as it be suppose to and i have no problem with it . there be situation however when i want to force the rollback in spite of there not be an exception … at the moment , i be force an exception when i encounter the right condition , but it 's ugly and i do not like it . can i actively call the rollback somehow ? the exception call it … i be think maybe i can too .
__label__anger	i have to do this once in note for a plugin i be develop . what i ended up do be edit the note template in the designer , and then write some lotusscript behind it that call a . net class via a dll. so when you click the button , it trigger the event in the lotusscript , and then call the dll , and pass the item information to it . i should also note that it be a freakin ' bear to figure out because note documentation be terrible .

__label__love __label__joy	we have deploy 's plot pack in both activex and . net flavor with great success . great api , incredibly flexible , provide a toolbar that let s user pan / zoom / customize . it 's solid , have a long track record , relatively inexpensive , and be very fast .

__label__anger	do not repost your blog post .
__label__anger	what be that downvote ? it 's real and valid question , and i hate drm too !
__label__sadness	sorry , i be not clear . you would need to add that as a bool property on your class . it originally sound as if you have a single place that handle the notification and display the error .
__label__joy	sure play around it , wp be easy it will just take a bit of time to get use to the structure .
__label__joy	@user0 : excellent ! please consider [ accept this answer ] ( #hlink# then 🙂

__label__anger	be there an easy way to find parse error in javascript code ? last week i be debug a javascript problem where the #ord# javascript function that be call give an ' object expect ' error . i later determine that this be because the browser be not able to parse my javascript code . i eventually solve the problem but it be a painful process that involve pour over my code line by line , try to find my mistake . there must be an easy way .
__label__anger	this do seem to be the answer . absolutely terrible api design .
__label__anger	get a spite downvote , it 's still a valid question .
__label__anger	i do not see how this be possible , but i really , really hate to run my query an extra time just to get the record count so i can build a pager . when i say a " pager " i simply mean the common gizmo with a link for each record for example .
__label__anger	@chris #crd# different control statement just to appease developer who want their switch statement to work in a slightly different way ? that 's a ** terrible ** idea . vb [ have that mentality for loop ] ( #hlink# and it work out terribly .
__label__joy	then perhaps might be of some help . if need be you could always do the registry edit yourself via api directly for the association … but up to you edit : also read the comment there , some good point eg the use of quote for path with space : @ " c:\somepath \ myapp . exe "" % "" also permission issue for registry access esp with vista … good luck 🙂

__label__sadness	not sure this answer the question accurately , what do everyone else think ?
__label__sadness	i be not for sure how the controlcollection of asp . net work , so maybe someone can shed some light on this for me . i recently discover the magic that be extension method and linq . well , i be very sad to find that this be not valid syntax however from what i can tell , do implement the interface which provide such method , so what give ? why do not that just work ? i have find a decent work around for this issue at least :
