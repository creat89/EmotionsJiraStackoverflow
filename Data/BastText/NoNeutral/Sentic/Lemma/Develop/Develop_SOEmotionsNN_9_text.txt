__label__love	you might want to look into jaxb . if you have a define xml schema it will automatically create java class that will easily allow you to ' marshal ' ( move datum from java - > xml ) and much much more . it 's incredibly useful !
__label__love	beaaaaaaautiful !
__label__love	excellent ! i get it work with your help .

__label__love	i have a few month of experience with ruby on rail and really love it from the beginning on . now , for work , i be ask to code in grails and although i #ord# have some objection , i now think it 's a very decent framework . #crd# thing that really impress me in grail be taglibs because they make frontend modularity so much easy . i would really like to do something with rail . be there anything like taglibs for rail ? if not , what be the good practice for accomplish this kind of view modularity ( and , in essence , make my life easy ) ?
__label__love	we use asp . net where i work and we be use c # as the language . will c # work with asp . net ? ive be try to pick up some book on c # , but not sure which i should be buy , any help would be greatly appreciate !
__label__love	i use for a medium sized project , and love it . it 's incredibly feature - rich , have pretty good documentation , and an amazingly good support forum -- it 's #crd# of those #crd# where you ask a question , and a guy who work for the company that produce the software almost invariably answer it within a few hour . i use it with php and mysql , but as far as i know it work with asp . net as well .
__label__love	awesome ! thanks .
__label__love	so i be use activerecord to get the count of item for a certain day : but this do not give me if there be no record for a give day , how can i fix this ? or be there be more " rail " way do to something like this ? any help be hugely appreciate , thanks again !
__label__joy	i have a huge html form . i be wonder if it be possible to use notepad ++ to copy the text from value = " [ copy this ] " and paste it into id = " [ paste here ] " and for = " [ paste here ] " on every line . if anyone have the solution to this , every web developer out there will be very happy 😃 cheer !
__label__joy	that 's a really cool functionality of php i do not know about ! i be not exactly sure how i would actually _ use _ it , but that 's still cool !
__label__joy	i now get it why it be sometimes facetiously refer to as the " hollywood principle : do not call us , we will call you "
__label__joy	so through an incredibly awesome coding session i manage to extract all the variable on the #ord# try . well , all check out except for array since the pdf i test on do not have #crd# in the aux info . all the datum from cgpdfdictionaryref be now in an nsmutabledictionary , so its usable . tomorrow i will be make the #ord# part to put it back into the other type that be need , cfdictionaryref . so if you want to wait i will post it up .
__label__joy	kill that process and restart and it work !
__label__joy	i have a table with a field that need to store character . my question be this : can you limit the length of a text field ( varchar stop at - i can not use it ) to character ? if i do that , will mysql run through the table quick due to the fix datum length , or do it act a bit like varchar in that the length can vary ? i do not have a table ( at all ) yet , but i be very conscious about speed and size for the future . i find this article : incredibly useful - maybe you will to ! thanks a lot , james
__label__joy	it 's a progress bar ! 🙂 setting make it a rotating circle rather than a classic progress bar . there be several different style you can use . play around with them to find the #crd# you like 🙂 hope this help !
__label__joy	i use excellibrary with very great result ! ( until now it support excel or low version ) .
__label__joy	in the absence of tuples , they be sometimes the clean way to do thing . i generally hate them , though . f # have some nice syntactical sugar for deal with them . rather than make me deal with parameter , it treat them as method that return tuples instead . the various method end up return #crd# element tuples : it 's quite handy , and do not make me feel dirty .
__label__joy	my pleasure 🙂 🙂
__label__joy	what be the problem ? create additional page and add it to wp , insert code there , and make an output page whatever you want . if you know php it will take you min .
__label__joy	this work super for me ! ( no pun intend )
__label__joy	here be some code to have a gif ( that already have transparency in it ) transform ( suppose you want to resize it ) in bitmap and then can be show properly with it 's transparency . good luck ! grã©goire lafortune
__label__joy	great ! i will take a look later . cheer .
__label__joy	if you be on 0g you be in luck 🙂 you can use select for update skip lock in the cursor - then you be guarantee that #crd# thread will never get the same row on a fetch ! the right way to do this in oracle would be advanced queueing - since this will solve all your problem , provide synchronization und parallel execution and other benefits….before oracle and without advanced queuing ( if you really want to code it yourself … ) you can do it like this :( the bit mark with autonomous transaction have to be call in a separate method as an autonomous transaction . if the update return row it can either be because the table be empty , or because #crd# thread access the same row . - so we need a separate end condition count available row .
__label__joy	work great !
__label__joy	excellent ! i will add it as an answer so you can close the question properly . glad i could help .
__label__joy	awesome 🙂 ! ! ! ! !
__label__joy	excellent . for some reason , datum bind in winforms never jump out at me as a solution no matter how much i use it in wpf.
__label__joy	wow , wow , wow ! i actually find a good way to do that … if i keep the same abbreviation and change template text into : it do want i want , but in the way cool way ! so you can use your own variable in a template as long as you do not call them or awesome !
__label__joy	@thorbjã¸rn ravn andersen that 's really great !
__label__joy	point = > good luck but god love ya for tryin ' !
__label__joy	if you handle the rowdatabound event you can check the value of the datum and modify the attribute of the cell or apply a different style in that event handler . that should give you what you be look for . let me know if you need it in vb rather than c # . good luck !
__label__joy	@drabjay : excellent suggestion ! code change . 🙂
__label__joy	i have #crd# namespaces : ) foo . bar ) #hlink# from a class in namespace , how do i reference a class in namespace ? use foo . bar leave you in namespace still … i hope this be reasonably clear ! thanks .
__label__joy	😃 😃 😃 😃 😃 😃
__label__joy	i hope you be joke 🙂 i want to collect general statistic on my typing and specifically not log everything since i be sure to type password .
__label__joy	ok after a lot of search i find the answer , which be relate to access request in django custom template tag … you can see the answer here : i use the follow : and then change the follow line : i really hope this help someone else ! 🙂
__label__joy	this be very fine 🙂 note that if you do the follow : only the #ord# element of the array will be initialize with the non-zero number whereas the rest will be initialize with #crd# .
__label__joy	scss be not __ good __ than sass , just different . it all depend on how you be use to write code . if you be use to haml - style terseness , then you could argue that sass be good ( less line of code , less syntax like brace , etc ) . just pick your flavor and enjoy !
__label__joy	i start wonder today if it would be possible to integrate joomla + cb with google app . if that would be possible we could have #crd# great product ! the #ord# thing that i would want to integrate be the logon - process , #crd# login for joomla + google app . then it would be great to have some google app module : - your late e-mail - your next calendar entry - your google talk buddy online / offline - your most recent doc and spreadsheet
__label__joy	be excellent 🙂 however instead of create a button object , i be only call an ontouchlistener to change the state of every view . give the same result though
