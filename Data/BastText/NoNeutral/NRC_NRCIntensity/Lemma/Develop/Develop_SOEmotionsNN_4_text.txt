__label__anger	no beta involve , the lack of repro be really annoy me !
__label__anger	iâ$™ll try this . string need to be iterable . and while we be at it : how come java be so damn awful ? no sane person would specify ` remove ` in an interface , just to add ` throw unsupportedoperationexception - if the remove operation be not support by this iterator ` .

__label__anger	i have a basic app write with atl , use the wizard with vs0 . i have a treeview in the left side of the app . i see how to ( painfully ) add tree item . question be how do i show a menu when the mouse be right click ? how do i trap any click event on each item that could be select ?
__label__anger	herbert 's answer be a suggested way of marginally automate the browser to check the box and click the delete button . if #crd# be to setup a browser automation project with selenium or such , then this would be a legitmate but painfully slow solution to delete all entity via the admin screen as it only delete at most entity at a time .
__label__anger	@suma how can this be a duplicate if the question you mention be post a year after this #crd# ?
__label__anger	this be similar to the accept answer ( because it be use java to represent the newline rather than el ) but here the < c:set / > element be use to set the attribute : the follow snippet also work , but the #ord# line of the < c:set / > element can not be indent ( and may look ugly ) :
__label__anger	i do not see how this be possible , but i really , really hate to run my query an extra time just to get the record count so i can build a pager . when i say a " pager " i simply mean the common gizmo with a link for each record for example .
__label__anger	on win with msvc there 's but it 's really horrible and you do not want to use it if you can possibly avoid it . good to say that there be no exception .
__label__anger	right , i have get this horrible mess of html and erb ( that do work ! ) , but i want to do thing properly and render the whole thing with the method . but i be not sure how to do this , i can only render text with the link_to at the moment .
__label__anger	i have a query that have approx column and i would like to export this to an excel file with the column header . i think this would be easy to figure out but no luck ! i search the web and find #crd# suggestion that do not end up work so i be stuck . anyone have any work idea ? thanks ,
__label__anger	i be try to pull the whole set of object that i want to work with into memory so i can cut down on call to the database . if i call a select for each iteration i be look at #crd# of #crd# of call , which be run horrifically slow .
__label__anger	@robáµ© i really hate pass booleans into function .
__label__anger	sorry , most of the code for this be #ord# party and i do not have access to it , make thing extremely difficult / frustrating .
__label__anger	i test this code out with an access database with no exception ( i go as high as insert ) . however , what i notice be that it be terribly slow as you be create a connection every time . if you put the " use ( connection ) " outside the loop , it go much fast .
__label__anger	i really hate use gui - designer for write a swing application ☹️
__label__anger	i do not understand this part : #crd# thing i have find with this be that pass the config around to all the other utility function that i would prefer and do not think should be a a part of #crd# the the above mention class can seem to get incredibly tedious . anyway , look up on thread - local storage . you could make a singleton config object that be thread - local .
__label__anger	fyi : when c or c ++ say " undefined " they usually mean " crash " or " memory corruption " or something equally terrible . beware .
__label__anger	it be be deprecate because it be old and unsafe . switch now or feel the pain later !
__label__anger	i be use vs0 , in a normal mid-size solution . sometimes , debug stepping become very slow . a padlock get render on the every file tab for every " step " ( f0 / f0 ) , and it can take up to #crd# #ord# for every step . that make debug very annoying and slow . have anyone see this problem ?
__label__anger	that link be full of horrible advice .
__label__anger	why do you need the class explicitly ? could not you use the interface ? note that casting be not encourage , which be why it look so awful in scala !
__label__anger	@chris #crd# different control statement just to appease developer who want their switch statement to work in a slightly different way ? that 's a ** terrible ** idea . vb [ have that mentality for loop ] ( #hlink# and it work out terribly .
__label__anger	no , it be not possible -- we try hard and ended up revert to the way of use a custom class … check maattachedwindow well with enough swizzling and pose it would be possible of course … but that be very evil and at least as much work as your own class !
__label__anger	be this seriously the only way to modify the default template ? this seem absolutely terrible .
__label__anger	schema - okay , have owner , but they can be a real pain to get permission right on .
__label__anger	i think i have comment . complete rubbish #hlink#
__label__anger	too bad this behavior be not a setting . i think it make sense in theory why they do it this way , but in practice it 's just really annoying
__label__anger	free the local array " buffer " be undefined , and probably horrible , behavior ! you can not free something unless it be allocate with malloc ( ) or calloc ( ) . it 's likely corrupt the heap and cause the crash .
__label__anger	in vc ++ mfc application project , i will not get the compile error , but when i run the project i will get the error debug assertion fail ! program : project . exe file : winocc . cpp line: for information on how your program can cause an assertion failure , see the visual c ++ documentation on asserts . ( press retry to debug the application ) what error it be and why this type of error occur , how to debug this error , plz help any body ,
__label__anger	i completely disagree with the answer so far . i feel that internal be a horrid idea , prevent another assembly from inherit your type , or even use your internal type should the need for a workaround come about . today , i have to use reflection in order to get to the internals of a #hlink# ( i have to build a datatable lightning fast , without all of its check ) , and i have to use reflection , since not a single type be available to me ; they be all mark as internal .
__label__anger	this do seem to be the answer . absolutely terrible api design .
__label__anger	it 's horrible ! no , seriously , i do not like it .
__label__anger	i have just finish that site , but there be a silly bug that remain … if you check tu horizontal position of the whole page there be a slight shift … nothing to cry about but why here be the page any idea , the horizontal css be : i do nt like my page to do the cha - cha - cha !
__label__anger	base mostly on , but also , and my own experience , i do not think it 's possible without a lot of ugliness , pain or without convert your linq to sql code generation over to ( not appealing , imo ) .
__label__anger	regex be a horrible option for perform replaces on a large amount of text . as powerful as it be , many regex proponent see all the world as a nail and regex as their hammer . for use case involve large amount of text , look at fastreplacer #hlink#
__label__anger	the problem that i be have be while design an email to be send to user the border of the html table be not disappear even though it be set to and so leave horrible white line through area which be menu to be solid blue color , below be my html code ! untitled document

__label__anger	i have be tackle the same issue . it 's a pain !
__label__anger	i really hate ask question that i feel be ask a #crd# time before . this be #crd# of those question i feel other must have encounter , , none of the suppose solution work for me so i must be do something wrong … i have an extremely simple app setup . index . htm , and term . htm . there be some textual datum in test . htm . i set both and at the appropriate time after stuff have load . at #ord# i try load term . htm ' s datum into an element within index use ( both test and index be in the same root / asset / www / directory , and my webview load index oncreate ) but absolutely nothing be happen . so i opt to try . ajax so that i could at least get an error message , and all i get be ' error ' . surely , it be possible to load local textual asset with jq on droidgap ?
__label__anger	terrible ! why do you post all that code ? #crd# asynctasks . do we have to dig through all that ? you should only post the relevant code .
__label__anger	i really hate to give any pointer without explanation but i think your requirement be big :: so -- >
__label__anger	it 's a terrible idea to include a use directive in a header file too . this simply mitigate that problem .
__label__anger	you can not move the cursor with javascript . it would be incredibly annoying anyways .
__label__anger	it be incredibly frustrating that outlook do not preserve the timestamp when you export . i have no idea why they decide to omit that .

__label__joy	this be simple i hope 🙂 when i create a new web application in wss do it need to be on port if i want to point an external domain name at it ? everything be standard in term of iis and port that be open i.e. port be the only #crd# open . i be guess if i let wss assign a port number to the new web application surely this can never be access externally unless i open the assign port ? cheer

__label__sadness	@gap : no , i never write the helper class , i be afraid .
__label__sadness	finally find something , here : no reference to it from the oracle page , but find a direct link to a page on some forum post . really sad how hard it be to find .

__label__anger __label__sadness	i have spend day try to find any information or work sample on how i can get google datum such as email in my gmail inbox , list of my contact , my calendar event etc … none whatsoever ☹️ there be broken piece of some code fragment here and there , % say it 's be deprecate , be the a #crd# single page on the internet that give me a work example how to do that from javascript . many page about oauth , but i have absolutely no idea how to use it , i have spend day read break piece here and there , but i be unable to understand what that it and how i can use it practically . very sad , and i be very tired to waste so much time on thing that do nt work and be not document in human language , possible to understand . why do they have to overcomplicate thing so much and spread broken piece of information everywhere ?
