__label__anger __label__sadness	i just tried installing those missing plugins ... what a pain !
__label__fear	i was afraid of that !
__label__fear	sorting the hashes is also a possibility that i have considered . i 'm a bit concerned about memory usage , but i 'll worry about that later .
__label__fear	scary question !
__label__fear	i 'm only generating the autogeneratedclass . the genericclass and its generichandler ( ) method are hand - coded in a different assembly from the autogeneratedclass altogether . so i 'm afraid this wo n't work .
__label__fear	i have a few classes which do nothing except in their constructors / destructors . here 's an example i 'm a little concerned about future readability . am i being too " tricksy " here , with a variable ( " busy " ) which is never actually used in the code ? could some static analysis tool suggest they be removed , or is this idiom sufficiently common not to worry about ?
__label__fear	i 'm cleaning up the css on a fairly large ( and somewhat disorganized ) website . is there a simple way ( or a piece of software ) that will let me find , for example , all the " a " tags that are within " h3 " tags ? or all the " spans " that are within " p " tags ? i want to modify some of these css rules but i 'm afraid i 'll break something hidden somewhere . any advice ?
__label__fear	linked lists have operations which a fifo queue does not ( enumerate the list , remove items from the middle , etc ) . so personally , i 'd fear that if a list is used as a queue without encapsulation , then in future some fool ( probably me ) will fail to observe the fifo constraint .
__label__fear	expected about users . i am worried that running + queries ( should be much more than that ) will eventually result in a timeout ‚Ä¶ now i am worrying whether i am creating a discussion rather than a qna
__label__love __label__surprise	i agree with @rogeria . this does n't explain why it is called the ioc and i am surprised by the number of up votes üòâ
__label__joy __label__anger	i discovered the problem : i created my rails project with and had a model ' dream ' as well . rails was looking at the application class instead of the model class . i got an error about dream already existing when i created the model and hand hacked my way around that ( in retrospect , a horrible idea ) . this has been very frustrating but i have learned quite a bit !
__label__sadness	@michael : dude , i feel your pain ( since my howto search led me here ) .
__label__sadness	ah - make me look lazy ! ( guilty )
__label__sadness	i afraid here the relation between c1 and c2 in a single row could not be maintained ! ! !
__label__sadness	i should add that the element thing throws an error when it ca n't find something . do you normally use try / except for all find_element commands ? * oh so very sad * ‚òπÔ∏è
__label__sadness	is it possible ( or desirable ? ! ) to set up to behave more like ? for example , instead of writing why ca n't i just write similarly , instead of why not just
__label__sadness	i 'm completely horrible with javascript and jquery , how do i get the content from a php file ?
__label__sadness	i have implemented this in my visual studio addon visual installer as intellisense member completion . if you type variable followed by a period (.) a list of all possible members of this class is presented in a list from which you can choose:second option is to move cursor over any class to view it 's members:see details here : http://www.unsigned-softworks.sk/visual-installer/features.html#member-completionp.s. sorry for this self promo - tlama is very angry for promoting 3rd party software in inno questions but there is no support for this in official inno setup editor and many people ask for this .
__label__sadness	first of all i ca n't see object locking , unused lockobject variable makes me sad . ienumerable is not special . each thread will have it 's own copy of reference to some instance of sektioner object . you ca n't affect other threads that way . what would happen with old version of data pointed by sektioner field largely depends on calling party .
__label__sadness	you can set the document . domain but if i remember correctly a few browsers ( opera ) will not even allow this . i am afraid your answer is to create some sort of proxy on the subdomain that you can talk through
__label__sadness	that 's very sad ‚òπÔ∏è
__label__sadness	i 'm not for sure how the controlcollection of asp . net works , so maybe someone can shed some light on this for me . i recently discovered the magic that is extension methods and linq . well , i was very sad to find that this is n't valid syntax however from what i can tell , does implement the interface which provides such methods , so what gives ? why does n't that just work ? i have found a decent work around for this issue at least :
__label__sadness	i understand its not a desirable circumstance , however if i needed to have some kind of html within json tags , e.g. : is this possible to do in python without requiring to to be escaped beforehand ? it will be a string initially so i was thinking about writing a regular expression to attempt to match and escape these prior to processing , but i just want to make sure there is n't an easier way .
__label__sadness	a unit test should do the same thing every time that it runs , otherwise you may run into a situation where the unit test only fails occasionally , and that could be a real pain to debug . try seeding your pseudo-randomizer with the same seed every time ( in the test , that is -- not in production code ) . that way your test will generate the same set of inputs every time . if you ca n't control the seed and there is no way to prevent the function you are testing from being randomized , then i guess you are stuck with an unpredictable unit test . ‚òπÔ∏è
__label__sadness	if i delete this question will it increase my reputation ? down votes it really sad .
__label__sadness	you could try this one ( not optimal , i am afraid ) :
__label__sadness	that is very very sad

__label__love __label__joy	i recently imported about 60k records into a table that relates data in one table to data in another table . however , my client has since requested that a sort order be added to all 60k records . my hope is there is a nice clean way to auto generate these sort orders in a sql update . the finished data should look something like this : can this be done ? any suggestions would be hugely appreciated . -- anne
__label__love __label__joy	excellent ! thanks .
__label__joy __label__surprise	wow ! yeah , i did 'nt know that ! great new feature .
__label__joy	well , without any third - party tools , i 'd say try using the clipboard ring , but roosteronacid 's idea about the snippet is probably quicker . hope that helps !

__label__joy	per : https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/ ? hl = enyou need to be registered as a member of a google + or google group that is designated for beta or alpha testing by the developer . if you are not registered , you will only be able to download the production app from google play , not the beta or alpha version of the app from google play . having the " link " wo n't be sufficient , you need to opt - in to the beta or alpha via google + or google group . please note that even if you properly opt - in via google + or google groups as defined by the developer , you will need to wait several hours ( perhaps - hours ) for your status to propagate via google play . so , perhaps you need to wait - hours even if your beta / alpha status is proper ? hope this helps !

__label__joy	proxy ( among many other meanings ) is a ** design pattern ** -- see [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proxy_pattern) for excellent coverage ( not intensely c ++ specific , of course ) .
__label__joy	i second trying to put the whole path instead . for relative paths , if you 're doing compiling and running in command line / terminal , you need to have that studentrecords . txt in the same directory of your code files . if you 're using an ide , you need to put your studentrecords . txt under the src / folder . this is assuming you 're not in maven project setup ; otherwise it should be put under / src / main / java / resources / . hope this helps !
__label__joy	got some code here that is n't working : basically i have lists and want to add a class ( last ) to each item appearing last in each unordered list . hope that makes sense , cheers !

__label__joy	for an excellent event manager class , check danny miller 's : http://k2xl.com/wordpress/ / / /as3-eventmanager-class-removealllisteners/
__label__joy	very annoying , but simply solved ! reason is that by writing you tell ruby : i 'm giving a block to this method call ‚Ä¶ and that 's obviously not what you want . simple fix : just add parentheses to your method call :

__label__joy	good luck !
__label__joy	try < % if ( viewcontext . viewname == " index " ) { %> should work fine ! ! ! edit : removed in beta1 removed the viewname property from the viewcontext class .
__label__joy	personally , if you think you can do huge amounts of refactoring , why not get the other student to come and sit with you and as you go , he / she can ask questions and maybe he / she has some ideas of their own . our industry moves fast , as i 'm sure you know , so your partner wo n't encounter other devs as forgiving as you . i 've added this as a comment because it does n't actually answer your question about unit testing . just wanted to give you something else to think about . good luck !
__label__joy	yup , for the better . it makes it harder to write hard to read code .
__label__joy	devexpress have a good one : the rangetrackbarcontrol control extends the functionality provided by the trackbarcontrol enabling end - users to select a range of values . two sliders can be used to set the minimum and maximum values : you can get them free from : hope this helps !

__label__joy	we eventually dropped using filestream . i believe we never could get it to work right with nhibernate . good luck !
__label__joy	my solution for at indexes and of any string would be : if this evaluates to true it means that the character at index x is enclosed by a set of parentheses . you can test for the index y respectively hope that helped , cheers ! alex

__label__anger	in general , this is a _ terrible _ idea . c ++ headers are not intended to be included in an alternately namespace as was used here .

__label__anger	start with master pages on day # - its a pain coming back to retrofit .
__label__anger	i got it ‚Ä¶ this is incredibly silly question ! static means i just access it directly from without using it from the instance .
__label__anger	yes definately turn off that solution wide processing . it 's a hog .
__label__anger	@mikechristensen that 's horrible üòê and weird ! !
__label__anger	most of the times when iphone program crash , compiler show stack with full of no 's , but these no 's do n't make any sense to me . very rarely it point out where the problem might be and mostly there are these useless no 's . how you can make sure that when your program crashes while development / testing , it shows at what place this cause this crash ?
__label__anger	this is n't really pythonic so much as tortured , but here 's a short version ( with meaningless - character variable names , no less ! )
__label__anger	obligatory i am not a lawyer . are you violating the legal clauses of the gpl ? probably not . ati and nvidia do this sort of thing with their graphics drivers for linux . however , it 's important to note that linux is gplv2 ; this may have changed with gplv3 . are you violating the spirit of the gpl ? yes , and judging from the way your question was written , you already knew this .
__label__anger	is there a way to create a batch api request with different access tokens to be used ? i need to crawl data from youtube channel using the offline access tokens of our users but the problem is we have 20k of that and having request at a time is really painful and is taking lot of time .
__label__anger	how is a question about hosting less programming related than this which gets plenty of up votes http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ /dealing-with-awful-estimates
__label__anger	here 's a really terrible hack if you do n't want the indirection and do n't mind doing the cleanup yourself :
__label__anger	the more i use updatepanels the more i hate them . i suggest you learn jquery or another javascript library and avoid using updatepanels all together .
__label__anger	i do n't use ironpython , but what i 've read so far about it does not certify the " incredibly bad python implementation " [ typo fixed ] .
__label__anger	the problem is that you never run the method , so the field stays at zero . it 's a really terrible idea to give a field and a method the same name .
__label__anger	well , you could play around a bit ‚Ä¶ what about a function that rewrites itself ? warning : this is extremely ugly and should not be used in production code !
__label__anger	how i hate myserlf !
__label__anger	this is a problem that regularly arises when i write silverlight xaml . in this case , i 've made a usercontrol verticaltabstop ( code attached ) that has a tooltip attached . i instanciate a couple of my usercontrols , and then i get the debugging window and the following error : i get an awful lot of these messages as i hover my mouse over the buttons . any suggestions to what i 'm doing wrong here ? cheers
__label__anger	okay .. after allot of trial and error i did something ( complete desperation ) and it worked ! this is too dumb , and if it were n't for the fact that some other person might have the same issue i 'd keep this to myself ..... i simply created a verticalfieldmanager that i added all the fields to , then added that vfm to the screen . point in fact this should not make any difference - at all - as the default manager on a screen is a vfm. nothing else . no other properties set , methods called , events .... nada . go figure .
__label__anger	@raubi : which bit ? it 's still going to be horribly inefficient for long sequences , as it 's still doing an enormous amount of string concatenation .
__label__anger	what i want to know is , what does create ? what can i do with it ? what does it mean ? every tutorial without fail will avoid talking about the first version entirely the reason the tutorial does n't rell you what to do with it is that it really is totally useless ! it allocates a single and gives you a pointer to that . the problem is that if you want an int , why do n't you just declare one ?
__label__anger	putting data in the id is a terrible , terrible idea .
__label__anger	i have a function name called setvalue , used in many classes . also , i have a global function by the same name . when i press c - ] , it goes to arbitrary setvalue function . how do i directly jump to the global setvalue function ? it is really pain to use tnext every time to find if the function global .
__label__anger	the tumblr iphone app looks awful -- both the gradients and the unnecessary boxed look imposed by the gray border . stick to the standard uitableview look . what apple uses for * their * apps is what looks most professional , not random novelty stuff .
__label__anger	indexed lookups in linkedlists are o (n) . that 'd could be terrible for a d array !
__label__anger	i recommend virtualbox . every time i use vpc i soon give up because the performance is terrible . i run virtualbox with a vista virtual pc allocated .5gb ram and it runs really well . in fact i do n't really notice much slow down from running natively .
__label__anger	i am extracting some data from sql server . one of the columns is a ntext column that has a blob of xml there . as i extract it , it looks really ugly . is there any way to format the xml inside a sql server stored proc ?
__label__anger	there 's some debate over that faq entry . yes , by all means , answer your own question . but if you routinely have a set of pre-baked questions and answers , then this site just becomes a blog , rather than an exchange . you have the misfortune of picking a day when someone abused the spirit of that faq .
__label__anger	i just flashed back to an old broderbund game ‚Ä¶ ca n't remember the name of it . awful cgi graphics , lots of cannon battles in old ships ‚Ä¶ maybe the first pirates game ? damn , that was an awful game . had a rollup scroll in it .
__label__anger	is search and replace the only way to rename as asp control in the code behind file ? i find this extremely annoying , but it is the only way i can find . scenario : i 'll find a variable that needs renaming ( usually to meet naming convention ) i 'll rename the variable in the aspx / ascx file . i 'll have to go in the code behind files and search and replace . i get annoyed are there any better ways - preferably that would not touch a similarly named variable in another scope in the project . i 'm on vs2008 with resharper -- does vs2010 address this perhaps ?
__label__anger	can you be any more specific about the scenario you have in mind ? " optimization " is a terribly broad category .
__label__anger	one thing i forgot , make sure the dev database you are running the migration from ( the sql server database ) is updated from production immediately before each test run . hate to have something fail on prod because you were testing against outdated records .
__label__anger	enlightenment dr16 is packaged with opensuse but it 's a bit painful to use with kde apps as there 's no obvious ( on the enlightenment site , google etc. ) way to provide a systray for kde apps that require one ( e.g. , ktorrent ) . anyone know of a way around this ? i 'm not using e for the eye - candy - i 'm running on a .6ghz celeron and kde ( ) performance is n't exactly stellar so i 'm trying out a few alternatives .
__label__anger	do n't repost your blog posts .
__label__anger	too bad it has n't been updated in years . and using the fetch / gclient is really painful
__label__anger	since changesets are becoming too many to handle because of many checkins , i 'm thinking of selecting multiple changesets then create a single work item link for code review purposes . it 's really painful to create work item per changeset and assign to a code - reviewer . is this possible ?

__label__anger	@vascowhite i tried deleting all the products from the cms then added a new one and the same message appears . really frustrating !
__label__anger	my form receives asynchronous callbacks from another object on random worker threads . i have been passing the data to the main thread ( where it can be used to update onscreen controls ) using delegates as shown below . performance is dreadful -- once i reach updates per second , the program completely locks up . my gui processing itself is not the problem , as i can simulate this level of updating within the form and have no problems . is there a more efficient mechanism i should be using to hand off the data from thread to thread ?
__label__anger	my guess would be from a colleague who wanted to scare this person out of ever using ' this ' again . it can be fairly annoying when someone uses ' this ' for every single thing they do . not that it justifies lying to a new programmer , but i can imagine someone doing this out of frustration .
__label__anger	more of a caution than a fix . ensure you are not an administrator of your page as being one fires both visible - to - connection and the else . very annoying !
__label__anger	makes sense , and it 's very similiar to what i am doing . one ant task for stage and one for production , and just using the defaults for local development . but pain arises from mainting different applicationcontexts which have almost identical content ‚Ä¶
__label__anger	in the end the answer was - yes - indeed . it was simply a delay between me adding my google test account and it actually being recognised as such üò° ! google should have a warning about this - in-app billing is a complete nightmare to code !
__label__anger	in netbeans , if i select some text and press , it works correctly and the text is indented to the right side as expected . but if i then try to backspace behind the text , it only removes one space at a time . very annoying . is there any way to change this setting , so backspacing behind a tabbed line causes the whole tab to be removed and not just space ?
__label__anger	there is a way to fix everything , but you will still hate the autotools until the end of time !
__label__anger	i was getting the same error when i tried to submit a version update from the organizer . what solved my issue was using the application loader found in the directory / developer / applications / utilities . you 'll need to compress your . app file and send the corresponding . zip file . i used this for my initial submission as well , i just thought i 'd try the new way . what a pain ! go with application loader .
__label__anger	an example : extremely frustrating !
__label__anger	i 'm trying to run a windows command in python that requires admin access . i have figured out a way using runas , but it opens a user account control pop - up , which almost defeats the purpose of the automation and is really annoying ! is there any way around this ? here 's my code for the admin command :
__label__anger	i would suggest flexunit for automated testing of libraries you 're building but it is a serious pain to use for a full application .
__label__anger	i have a function : basically it just uses the plugin to nudge an image on mouseover to one slide and then another , to give the effect of a shake . i can see my code looks absolutely horrible , ( i come from a php / c # background ) can anoyone suggest a better means to achieve my goal ?
__label__anger	no , they 've stopped working again and gone back to the forbidden message . incredibly annoying .
__label__anger	back in the day i had to solve this with a panel where the text box is a component inside and had dockpadding set to or pixels . i 'd then style that panel to a single pixel . i always found this really annoying !

__label__anger	how does one make m - ( the default behavior for typing an opening " ( " character ? i want emacs to automatically insert the closing " ) " after the cursor when i type a " ( " character regardless of whether it 's part of an m - key combination . additionaly , i want to extend this behavior to quotes , subquotes , brackets and braces . typing m - ( is a pain , and there do n't appear to be any comparable forms for those other characters .
__label__anger	i have an asp:menu control that has four different menu items in it . each menu item has a graphic and a text description . my problem is the icon and text have no padding between them and it just looks ugly ! does anyone know how i can force a bit of padding between the image and text of the menu item ? i 've looked at all of the attributes on the asp:menu control , but i have n't been able to find one for this , but i may have just missed it .
__label__anger	in sublime text , if i press escape the page goes into command mode , which seems to take text input as commands , rather than actually typing the text . another oddity is the visual mode , and i have no idea what it does besides it seems to highlight text . i think they came installed with the theme that i got , ' soda ' , maybe . anyway , i searched and found out you can turn off command mode by pressing ' i ' . regardless , both of these modes are extremely annoying , how do i get rid of them ?
__label__anger	if i can avoid it , no . and , to my knowledge , there is always a way to avoid it . but i 'm not stating that it 's totally useless either
__label__anger	yes another reason to hate ie !
__label__anger	i absolutely hate how tabs work in xcode . however , the only workaround i found that works decent is using the osx tabs shortcuts : ctrl + cmd + - > ctrl + cmd + < -
__label__anger	i 'm calling onto some code that returns me an http response . i can get the contents of the response which returns me a byte array . the bytes represent a zip file that i would like to extract and get the contents of a single file ( the zip only contains one file ) . currently i have some messy code ( i 'll need to clean it up if i keep it ) that seems to work : but was wondering whether there was a cleaner way to do the same thing because the above looks incredibly ugly .

__label__love	thank you for the excellent answers ! @arnoldspence is correct : it is indeed a case of memory fragmentation . i confirmed this by modifying my example above to allocate a series of mb buffers after the reaching the " out of memory " condition . sure enough , these all succeeded ( up to the 2gb limit ) .

__label__love	excellent answer !
__label__love	works great ! and you can add " desc " after the end to sort in other direction . in which case the strings will show first . i like how this solution does nt actually pad the numbers in the result output .

__label__love	i agree with pw. opal is an excellent choice . it supports audio and video devices it compiles on windows , linux , and a few others also - i recommend using the sip protocol ( as opposed to h323 ) - you do n't need to use ekiga . ekiga is a front - end to opal . you can take a look at the opal samples , and build up from those .

__label__love	no worries stephen !
__label__love	@ryanc : excellent ! now i understand what is going on , rather than just thrashing , as before . i think your explanation ( about the canvas ignoring ` refresh - now ` before it is open ) is very sensible .

__label__love	i did a lot of vrml + java work in college and loved it , but i feel like it 's not really a marketable skill . has anyone worked with a high level graphics api like open inventor , coin .. etc that is actually in use to a degree that makes investing a lot of time in the api worthwhile for something more than a hobby ?
