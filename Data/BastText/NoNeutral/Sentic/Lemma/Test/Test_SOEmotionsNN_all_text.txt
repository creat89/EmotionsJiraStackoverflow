__label__anger	by the way , i agree with henrik p. hessel . this be a very horrible piece of code .
__label__anger	as you can see folk hate spend time give detail on bad advice !
__label__anger	the #crd# be not mutually exclusive , archmage .
__label__anger	it 's impossible to receive unicast udp packet in silverlight ( rage ! ! ! ) .
__label__anger	that be awful advice ! i do not mean to be overtly mean but i loll .
__label__anger	oh , absolutely horrible practice . but still the answer he be look for .
__label__anger	try it again - it work . god i hate report service !
__label__anger	someone be scared to tell the reason of downvote !
__label__anger	i have just start use vim in a terminal ( putty or mintty ) , after always use gvim . however , when use syntax highlight , rather than the actual text colour change appropriately , its background be change to whatever colour -- and it look horrible ! i have set my terminal to use color and download a colour colour scheme . i check that the and setting be as i expect , but i still get this problem … be this a vim or a terminal configuration issue ?
__label__anger	i be develop a web page which embed a " google map " view . in this web page , the user must specify several position on the map at this time , i be able to spread the balloon on the map display when the user click on a button to be drag , but accord to the zoom it can be very painful to zoom in and out to drag the balloon to a place . i would like to know if it could be possible to have a panel with all balloon to drag / drop on the map ? my current development : my target :
__label__anger	i be do #crd# app which require ajax call on almost every user interaction possible , i start write js function , webservices etc. to handle all of that ( still long way to go from here ) . now i be wonder if i make a mistake maybe i should put whole page in update panel because i really hate write js. be there some drawback to use it instead of custom write ajax call to web service and js function , and be it good to use more update panel or #crd# big ?
__label__anger	i be try to do this in a makefile and it fail horribly : do you know why ? i guess it have to do with escape , but what and where ?
__label__anger	do … stackoverflow make you wait several minute . i really hate that
__label__anger	why would you do that ? you be beg for horrible debugging session !
__label__anger	i do not see how this be possible , but i really , really hate to run my query an extra time just to get the record count so i can build a pager . when i say a " pager " i simply mean the common gizmo with a link for each record for example .
__label__anger	edit : also you should avoid use it can make debug extremely frustrating .
__label__anger	ew , the ` com ` prefix be horrible !
__label__anger	i write something that do work , but it 's extremely ugly , but think it could either help someone else or we could get something good . here 's what i come up with :
__label__anger	i be very jealous of your name !
__label__anger	ef ctp0 be still have this bug ! anyway there be a simple work around for now see more here : be aware that count ( ) be total rubbish performance wise !
__label__anger	as be already establish , this be a miserable , horrible , awful , and terrible idea from a concurrency perspective . anyway , since your question be really about go 's type system , here 's how you would define a type with a recursive method .
__label__anger	i can not seem to figure out why the phpunit target do not output any test result even though i have test in position . the problem i be find be there be no indication as to what the problem be ! incredibly frustrating . the output be as follow : my build . xml be as follow : my system : vista , php , phpunit , phpundercontrol , cruisecontrol
__label__anger	okay so say we have a graph with a ball on it at ( ) and we swipe our finger from ( , ) to ( ) how do i go about move the ball to ( ) ? this should be simple but it be really hurt my head ! this be the code i have so far ( use andengine )
__label__anger	after read i be horrify ! be not there a tool out there that can inspect a . h / .cpp file and deduce what dependency could be waivered ?
__label__anger	horrible answer because it be just wrong .
__label__anger	i have create a vb . net lending application for a cooperative that cater to widow . the application track the member ' loan and payment , and be also use as an accounting system . in my #ord# release , the user feel that show a messagebox every time an error occur be very annoying . my solution be to output error in a label control . the user accept the modification , but i feel i be do it wrong .
__label__anger	this be a terrible idea , as a compact on a database already in a suspect state can lose datum that would otherwise be recoverable before the compact . compact on close should under all circumstance be turn off .
__label__anger	#ord# between ask and answer it yourself ? be not that abuse the system a little ?
__label__anger	another thing i hate to see be the : i have see this in real code .
__label__anger	vote ? ? people who have downvoted this answer should have specify the reason for do so as well .
__label__anger	i have try msysgit and git on cygwin . both work just fine in and of themselves and both run gitk and git - gui perfectly . now how the heck do i configure a mergetool ? ( vimdiff work on cygwin , but preferrably i would like something a little more user - friendly for some of our more … windows - love coworker . ) thanks !
__label__anger	i want to catch all url 's in the root folder of the url #hlink# the url can not end in a trail slash , and can not contain any slash at all . so these should pass : #hlink# #hlink# #hlink# ** fail ! #hlink# ** fail !
__label__anger	the ebook summarise thread . suspend and thread . resume thusly : the deprecate suspend and resume method have #crd# mode â $ " dangerous and useless ! the book recommend use a synchronization construct such as an or to perform thread suspend and resume .
__label__anger	i have a . net assembly that have a com + servicedcopmonent in it and at the moment i install it into the gac to get everything work . this mean that i need to have every assembly that it reference in the gac as well . during development it be quite painful to make change to th assembly , re-install them to the gac and then test . be it possible to maintain the com + component but not have everything in the gac ?
__label__anger	i need to pass a regex substitution as a variable : this , of course , do not work . i try eval'ing the substitution : but that do not work either . what horribly obvious thing be i miss here ?
__label__anger	why would you want to do that ? ? no offense , but that be the most annoying and useless ' feature ' ever !
__label__anger	be there a way to run a specific ant task via the keyboard ? i have a rsync to dev task that i run a lot and run to the mouse to double - click be a pain .
__label__anger	i have a column contain the string ' operator ( ) ' and so on until ' operator ( ) ' so far . i want to get them numerically order and i have come up with which be very very ugly . good suggestion ?
__label__anger	background : i be currently debug an application write over a custom - build gui framework in c ++ . i have manage to pin down most bug , but the bug i be have the most trouble with tend to have a common theme . all of them seem to be to do with the screen refresh , redrawing or updating to match provided datum . this be a pain to debug , because i can not break on every refresh , and most of this stuff be time - sensitive , so breakpoint occasionally " fix " the bug . q : do anyone have any tip for debug windows - base gui , especially regard the refreshing of individual component ?
__label__anger	something that have always bug me be how unpredictable the method in javascript be . in my experience , the timer be horribly inaccurate in a lot of situation . by inaccurate , i mean the actual delay time seem to vary by m more or less . although this be not a huge amount of time , when use it to hide / show ui element the time can be visibly noticeable . be there any trick that can be do to ensure that perform accurately ( without resort to an external api ) or be this a lose cause ?
__label__anger	i have be trim the ui of our website by do the follow in the onload event of that control : this have become very tedious because there be so many control to check again and again . as soon as i get it all work , designer request to change the ui and then it start all over . any suggestion ?
__label__anger	it be extremely unreliable and if there be constant build go you never know the actual build be broke .
__label__anger	the build in #crd# be awful . you can easily write your own rss , rdf and atom parser . i have a tutorial and a full visual studio project you can download that do just that #hlink#
__label__anger	what you be ask be inherently impossible . the game run on the client and be therefore completely at the user 's mercy . only way to be sure be run a real time simulation of the game on the server base on user 's input ( mouse movement , keypresses ) , which be absolutely ridiculous .
__label__anger	if another person say nunit , i be gon to puke ! where tf do you people learn to read ?
__label__anger	suppose i have this interface and this class be there a way , or be there a tool that can let me automatically put in the comment of each member in a base class or interface ? because i hate re-write the same comment for each derive sub-class !
__label__anger	i would agree except they be related and i really hate the idea of write separate question since they seem to close .
__label__anger	that 's really bad . gwt look extremely ugly with ie0 default !
__label__anger	someone be scared to tell the reason of downvote !
__label__anger	why be ` abstractmap . simpleentry ` convoluted ?

__label__anger	be there a way to zoom extent of a collection of shape without compute min / max xy 's and wh 's - very painful when slope line be involve . perhaps some kind of pixel detection ?
__label__anger	i be new to ror and be find the scattered documentation extremely frustrating ! when the command rail generate model or rail scaffold be any fileds automatically create . i be think here about the id field in particular . additionally , could anyone point me to the documentation which specify this ?
__label__anger	combine nh attribute and some fnh automapping stuff look very scary . i do not understand it at all but imo classic classmap be much more transparent . you must pay with more key stroke but your head hurt less :) . and this code delete connection and endpoint as well from database :
__label__anger	your formatting be absolutely horrible to read . could you fix that ?
__label__anger	what an awful api !
__label__anger	we in the process of build an ios app ( it 's yet to be launch ) . we be try to implement push notification as part of the build . we have set this up via amazon sns and have create and register an app certificate for the app which contain push notification permission . basically we send the app message from server code - it state that it have be publish and it return the message id but the device do not receive anything . to clarify the device register ok for remote notification and return a device token . very frustrating ! do anyone have any tip ?
__label__anger	i agree , we often face this problem when use 0g xe database , this be really annoying !
__label__anger	trigger quirk mode be a terrible , terrible , terrible thing . in quirk mode , jquery be force to use alternative method to interact with the dom and be almost definitely the cause of your speed issue in ie .
__label__anger	i be try to generate api documentation via cabal and haddock . i want it to be latex . so i do : this fail ultimately with : be there something i can do or be something wrong with haddock ? fyi , i have to use cabal since the build process be rather complicated ( lot of preprocessor , ffi library , .. ) . invoke haddock manually be really painful . building html documentation however be work completely as expect . the complete output be at . i be use :
__label__anger	@sjdowling when downvoting someone you be suggest to explain why …
__label__anger	#crd# non-technical consideration . embed free datum inside english phrase be not go to look very smooth in many culture ( include western #crd# ) , where you need grammatical agreement on e.g. number , gender or case . a more telegraphic style usually help ( e.g. excellent input : " xyz " ) -- then at least everybody get the same level of clunkiness !
__label__anger	ok , finally get this to work . horrible documentation online ! i be post my code in case other be have trouble :
__label__anger	be look at this for day …
__label__anger	that be incredibly frustrating !
__label__anger	i have a somewhat complicated issue . i have a grid define ( use the struts0 - jquery grid plugin ) . #crd# of the column have a custom formatter that call a javascript function to put a button into that column . ( note : i absolutely hate do it that way ) . the point of the button be to open up a dialog box . this dialog box contain a checkboxlist , which can not be render in the grid . somehow , i need to pass a parameter to the action that return the view that will be display inside the dialog . since this be somewhat complex , here be the code : grid definition : javascript custom formatter : dialog definition : remote manage role jsp ( trim ) : since i get the id of the grid object via javascript , but use the jsp taglib for the dialog , how can i pass the id around ?
__label__anger	android app be constrain to a certain amount of memory . as it 's quite ( insanely ? ) low , i think you should not feel guilty about use all of it ! the limit be mb on very old device , mb or mb on new #crd# . there do not seem to be much info on the size for different device , and nobody seem to know why the limit be so small when modern phone have gb of ram . aha , i find some concrete number on the limit : g0 : 0mb droid : 0mb nexus #crd# : 0mb xoom : 0mb
__label__anger	@milhous * everything break when you use java * .

__label__anger	i be use vim with pythoncomplete . when i be make a completion , the current window be split and calltips be show in the upper pane . i hate that ! be there a way to prevent that behavior or at least limit the size of the upper pane automaticly ?
__label__anger	i get iphone app . when i start it , i see black view . this black view be show before app 's #ord# view . and it look really awful . can i set here preview picture ?
__label__anger	that be not about programing .
__label__anger	link ( burstproject . org ) be inactive and seem to have revert to horrible go daddy wall of link / ad .
__label__anger	@gnud : no , it 's not an implementation detail . it make it a pain when you have be give an integer in " natural " base ( i.e. jan = ) and you need to use it with the calendar api .
__label__anger	you should fix the library that be create bad or non-named thread . i would hate to debug your library ' thread only to find that the name where change elsewhere .
__label__anger	upvote for the / f i have write couple of script for that but without / f it be such a pain ; require me to be there when run the script to type " y + [ return ] "
__label__anger	i have several #crd# ( static - no includes or server - side parsing ) html page . i would like to validate the html ( xhtml transitional ) , but the idea of plug each of them individually into the w0c validator - or even use a firefox plug - in to open each #crd# - fill me with dread . do anyone know of any ( windows ) app that can do bulk validation ? the " validate entire site " feature on be the close i have come , but that 's limit to page .
__label__anger	yep , the power tool should let you do this , but unfortunately the merge go horribly wrong each time so it 's next to useless .
__label__anger	im not sure what they be call but im refer to the keyword in c ++ . be there an equivalent in c # ? it seem rather tedious have to repeat yourself ! ala
__label__anger	so for my text parse in c # , i get direct at yaml . i be hit a wall with this library i be recommend , so this be a quickie . and so on . be that valid ?
__label__anger	@andy : give him the useless use of cat award !
__label__anger	` cat $ ( find $ folder - name " * . txt " ) ` that 's terrible !
__label__anger	i have this strange problem on my web page where if you click below the left side - panel , all the link get highlight . it happen in firefox , not ie . i do not know why its only the side - panel that it happen to . its not really a big deal but its extremely annoying to me , be there any way to stop it ? if you want to check it out , the site be
__label__anger	i be try to figure out why foundation be act differently to expect behaviour . if you look at the kitchen sink page for foundation , the default style for secondary button hover affect be different to what i get if i set foundation up in rail . note these image be from my rail application image - look at the ' . tiny . secondary ' button - no hover image - look at the ' . tiny . secondary ' button - with hover however on the page for foundation the color do not transition to the primary colour of the site . it transition to a dark shade of grey . have i miss some setting ? really frustrate me ! i be guess this be a bug in foundation
__label__anger	strange error . #crd# of which i can not find any exist resource to solve the issue . the issue be , when use i get point to a folder at " c:\program file ( x0 ) \common files\microsoft shared\devserver\ " . naturally , this break everything which depend on the correct folder ( the #crd# my solution be actually in ) be give . what be more strange be that there exist a unit - test to make sure that this path at least have the correct root folder and sometimes it will pass and will be work as expect , and then the very next debug , will point to the aforementioned folder again . very confusing and very annoying ! any idea ?
__label__anger	in addition to firebug ( which should be your #ord# port of call ) , the will also tell you where a give style be source from , just in case ie - shock , horror - should be different .
__label__anger	i really hate this option . i be look at manage this by gpo in my org .
__label__anger	we be run jenkins on a server that do not have internet access ( even through proxy ) . instal and keep the jenkins installation up-to - date be a pain ! my idea be to make a local mirror of the complete jenkins public update - site through a windows workstation that have internet access . and then make this local mirror available to jenkins through nfs share . so my question : how to make the local mirror ? do you have a good / simple idea to keep the jenkins installation up-to - date ?
__label__anger	i really hate think that code can tell me how to think instead of me tell it what to do .. anyway .. here be an example for load the controller render the page , and it can load any controller inside the helper . edit : just realiced this be such an old post ☹️ .. this be work in cakephp
__label__anger	this be probably cause because you have set to ( which be absolutely terrible ) . ( see ) you should disable register globals so that the session / post / get / request / cookie variable do not interfere .
__label__anger	anyone ? ? ? i be start to hate vs for that reason !
__label__anger	i be go crazy guy , my label be not update in my view after run "" and "" ! this be what i try so far : make sure there be no "" string around in po file delete mo file relaunch and delete all . file in my project delete browser cache change browser drop the local database and launch synchdb shout to the monitor the command i launch be the following : be there any sort of django caching mechanism relate to compile mo file that i have to empty ? what can i do ? i be really furious ! 😐 '
__label__anger	@kolink oh , i hate facebook for many more reason !
__label__anger	i have be try to use offlineaudiocontext and the fft analyzer in chrome with a script processor but i be run into the same issue that this person have : in that so answer , someone point out this bug report : but it be over a year old ! my question be : do anyone know if this will be fix anytime soon and should i file a bug elsewhere ? be that bug report ( that be a year old ) still be look at ? or well yet , maybe someone know a workaround ? my code be essentially the same as the jsfiddle on that so link . it 's really sad that this stuff do not work in chrome but it do in firefox .
__label__anger	too slow and i prefer to operate in the same mode as my user . also , i just really hate switch to debug . and its a waste of diskspace .
__label__anger	it 's the most ugly ☹️ ☹️ ☹️
__label__anger	there be no tcp multicast , i would vote this down , but i do not have enough reputation .
__label__anger	@gabrielepetronella i miss that link , i hate how stackoverflow remove the underline ! be you run it on a server or file protocol ?
__label__anger	it 's a command - line tool . unforunately xcode do not use codesense for editing file outside a project , which be incredibly frustrating .
__label__anger	how absolutely terrible you can not set control not to show up on the print
__label__anger	yes , same happened to me .. sometimes define can be really horrible .
__label__anger	do you ever solve this problem ? i have just come across it and it 's really annoying , especially because my video do not even have audio !
__label__anger	xcode console not show after exit app and reopening . i put a simple nslog in the next screen that i push to and there be no logging of it in my console . this make it a pain to debug ! i segue from #crd# screen to a tabbar controller , if that help ? have anyone encounter this issue ?
__label__anger	indeed , this be awful . a pity there be no option to change it . every other ide / editor i use open tab to the right .
__label__anger	i for check whether the function exist yet . in summary : do that work for you ? if it do then you can just wrap in a loop . a bit less nasty than a settimeout !
__label__anger	downvote this be due to omit " var " before " a " make it global and be unrelated to the question .
__label__anger	malice ? seriously though , it 's hard to account for formatting style sometimes . it 's largely a matter of personal taste . personally , i think that both form be a little nasty unless you be seriously restrict in term of line - length .
__label__anger	i have an . ico file with icon size embed in it be use as the main application icon and the system tray icon . when it show up in the task bar the icon be use the 0x0 format which be desire . when the icon show up in the notification area / system tray , it be use the 0x0 format and windows be render it down to a 0x0 icon , which look horrible . how do i force window to use the 0x0 icon size in the notification area ? here 's my code to put the icon in the system tray :
__label__anger	i wonder if it 's possible to set the editor windows tab width in eclipse . i hate it when i want to close several window in a row and i always have to move the mouse . can i set eclipse to use only #crd# width for every window tab ?
__label__anger	this be probably silly but very frustrating . use vs0 with a c ++ project , when i be work normally , the breakpoint window be visible and active but when i be debug it disappear and can not be show . this be a problem if i want to edit the condition of a breakpoint while run . press the breakpoint window button do not do anything and neither do press ctrl + alt + b do this happen to anybody else ? it 's a brand new install with visual assist and qt integration as extension . same configuration with vs0 do not have any problem .
__label__anger	i do hate the plain id name . i strongly prefer to always use the invoice_id or a variant thereof . i always know which table be the authoritative table for the id when i need to , but this confuse me what 's bad of all be the mix you mention , totally confusing . i have have to work with a database where almost always it be foo_id except in #crd# of the most used id . that be total hell .
__label__anger	notably , the debugger show the string * with * escape character . when the string be print in the console , the escape character be not include . " \ " code \ "" vs. " code " . this character limit be very annoying as it prevent you from copy , say , a long json string and then immediately paste that string ( escape character include ) as a test string variable in your code .
__label__anger	@devsolar i would like to use boost more , but its synergy with c ++ be terrible , and there be some rather … _ curious _ design decision ( iostreams require device to be copyable , but make stream noncopyable … oh , and also nonmovable - at least in the implementation i be use , maybe they fix it ? ) .
__label__anger	would have love to . but there be no hash_map in the c ++ standard library , and phb 's do not allow code outside of that .
__label__anger	i have a class , let 's call it linegraph , that render a line graph . i need to subclass it , but the derive class be only use in #crd# place and be couple to the class that use it . so i be use an inner class . i see #crd# way to do this : anonymous inner class name inner class i be not a fan of anonymous inner class , because frankly i just think it look really ugly . but in the case of a subclass that 's only use in #crd# place , be a name inner class overkill ? what be the accept practice ?
__label__anger	not an answer , but why on earth would you want item in a combo box ? that be a terrible way to store that much datum .
__label__anger	i hate use uml tool till i find #hlink# which offer some sort of dsl to describe uml diagram . no mouse - fiddleling any more 🙂 .
__label__anger	evaluation of what ? i may be be slow today , but i really do not understand what your problem be . i be awful tempt to vote to close on the principle that i do not see a real question .
__label__anger	be search and replace the only way to rename as asp control in the code behind file ? i find this extremely annoying , but it be the only way i can find . scenario : i will find a variable that need rename ( usually to meet name convention ) i will rename the variable in the aspx / ascx file . i will have to go in the code behind file and search and replace . i get annoy be there any good way - preferably that would not touch a similarly name variable in another scope in the project . i be on vs0 with resharper -- do vs0 address this perhaps ?
__label__anger	why be i use over % cpu when just hover some link ? as you can see in the video i upload : the cpu go to > % cpu when i move my mouse over the link . my style for the item be as follow why ?
__label__anger	the function be extremely annoying because it use a prototype or something insane like that . you would have to do an ampersand - call to override the prototype : . however , you be try to transpose the matrix , not to it ( which would produce a continuous list like we could use an iterator in conjunction with : which work , but this be severely overthink the problem . let 's just swap index :
__label__anger	the search term on both stackoverflow and pinvoke . net yield #crd# result , so this should be worth ask . i have be fiddle around on msdn and look through win sdk * . h file all day , and feel a bit out of my element . i be basically attempt to query the msrpc endpoint mapper with manage code . here be what i have so far : the above code be not complete , but it illustrate my point . the code consistently return : rpcmgmtepeltingnext : meaning parameter be incorrect accord to . so i be basically stump at this point , and i be sure it 's because of my extremely crappy pinvoke code .
__label__anger	why would you want to do that ? your use case sound extremely malicious .
__label__anger	what a sad answer ! ! maybe i can just do not install it , and leave the hell to user .
__label__anger	gridview ? and accept some answer , for cry out loud !
__label__anger	i keep a bitmap inside a movieclip , bitmap have be set to be smooth . but when i change the scale of this movieclip , it still get pixelated . do we have the way to avoid . it be really painful .
__label__anger	this be not the answer but i figure out a very sad workaround . extend the textview component class in the constructor of the subclass , fire off the code .. yuck
__label__anger	i just update my macvim to and with it , it now change directory to whatever file i be currently edit . i use peepopen , so it 's incredibly annoying to cd back to my project directory every time i want to edit a new file .
__label__anger	i be currently workin on a visual studio online hosted project that use git for version control and have run into a problem with the team explorer menu . all of my collegues get this view when connect to the project : but on my machine , im miss the tile / button and have to right click the current branch , choose manage branch and from there , select change / unsynced commit to handle my code which be extremely annoying . im use visual studio ultimate for this project , but i also have vs0 instal .
__label__anger	never be this frustrate before … i hate uis ! will have to deal with them #crd# day
__label__anger	to my limited knowledge , in android , any activity must belong to a give process . however , the book say : " the activity life cycle be not tie to the process life cycle . " that be to say , even if the process have be completely kill , its activity can still be alive ! what make me confused be : because the input handler of an activity be bind to the process . if the process have be kill , how do its activity react to the user 's input ?
__label__anger	i would guess it be do basic sanity check ( i.e. should anything have change ) - to prevent unexpected source code change ( i hate it when open a file can cause side - effect - i be look at you , dbml ! ) . on a side note , to force serialization generally ( i do not think it will apply due to the above ) : the and be a convention use by the framework .
__label__anger	this be heinous . i would not allow such a thing to survive a code review .
__label__anger	it seem very tedious ! i have a #crd# table join to join together , where #crd# of the table be a inner join and the rest be left outer join . be it doable in entity ?
__label__anger	for some reason that still hate me !
__label__anger	i be refer to this behaviour : ( windows do not include the mouse cursor in the screen shot , i be hover on the uppermost (+) here . ) i find this incredibly annoying in some case , especially with large method . in , i have both checkboxes blank .
__label__anger	i now have this extremely ugly solution . anybody a good idea ?
__label__anger	okay , so give the overwhelmingly negative response , do anybody think db image storage be _ ever _ justify ?
__label__anger	i have a complex site that incorporate alot of javascript and it be get absolutely kill by ie0 . how would i go about serve this code : html js in such a way that ie0 never get the and therefore never hide ?
__label__anger	my #ord# instinct be to branch normally ( use p0 integrate ) , and then use an ide or sed script to change the package name . but this make future integration from the trunk extremely painful .
__label__anger	this be the #ord# post i have see with people filter by * ascii * char - code - it 's a terrible idea ! where be you get these example from ?
__label__anger	i think it should be a warning . generally speak , the common rule be that ' you should treat warning as error ' . if i unintentionally write unreachable code , i will see it in the warning , and fix it anyway . however , sometimes , like neil say , you intentionally create dead code , for debugging purpose or whatever reason . i would really , really hate it if the compiler would not let me do that .
__label__anger	i have run into this too . it be very annoying ! here 's why it might be happen . the width of your li item , plus any margin be more than the width of #maincontainer . that mean the last li item spill over #maincontainer and the script will want to move that last bit in , leave an extra click . #crd# way to check this : assign an id to the last li , and make the width less , and see if that do not fix it . if so you need to make the #maincontainer wide .
__label__anger	do not mean nothing . you have to use
__label__anger	i realise this be probably an absolutely horrible way to do a query , and of course its not work . the point of it be to select user base on a date range and a keyword .
__label__anger	i think this will be what i be go to go with . i really hate deal with xml file .
__label__anger	my goal be to write a cookie when the user authenticate . we be use a crappy framework that hide its source code and event model so when i use their login control i can not set a session timeout on it ! anyhow , i be try to write a cookie when the user be log in , and then refresh the cookie expire time on subsequent page view ( slide expiration ) . so i figure i could initially create the cookie during application_authenticaterequest in teh global . asax but that seem to be fire even when the user have not sign in yet . be that suppose to be the case ?
__label__anger	i be not sure why this answer be accept . this simply be not the correct answer . deadlock can occur whenever you have multiple thread . there 's nothing inherent in gui program that make them more likely to happen . furthermore , they can easily happen even if you use begininvoke ( ) . brian ensink 's answer be the correct #crd# .
__label__anger	apart from the book available from , i be look for some link to any resource that could help in learn the vtk library . preferably , with example code and tutorial . google result have not be terribly informative for me . so i be ask here for link to vtk resource .
__label__anger	ugh , implicit join ! i want to tear my eyeball out look at that .
__label__anger	i really fail to see the use case … if you will type print_var_name ( $foobar ) what 's so hard ( and different ) about type print ( " foobar " ) instead ? because even if you be to use this in a function , you would get the local name of the variable … in any case , here 's the in case there 's something you need in there .
__label__anger	yes , these query be horrible . do a regular join instead .
__label__anger	yes , the question mention it wo not work . i be try to describe why it be not terribly important to even try to do it that way .
__label__anger	agreed . do not do this , it make people cry .
__label__anger	i do not know why the editor be give me so much trouble . at #ord# the code block would not do anything but indent , so i have to change it to pre tag . then my carefully number sequence be now all 0s . this thing be make me look ridiculous !
__label__anger	from my own experience , microsoft sql compact framework be a real no - go . it be really freak slow and its query analyzer be just really poor . i have to ask my team to rewrite all the plumbing code of my windows mobile component to get rid of the awful performance of sql ce .
__label__anger	how awesome would it be if the delphi ide would put code in format on the clipboard , so that code that be copy and paste in e-mail or word - document have proper highlight instead of plain text ? !

__label__anger	talk about consume wcf service in silverlight , but claim : there will be no proxy , no generate code , no #ord# party utility , and no disgusting " add service reference " usage . what be so wrong with me add a service reference in my silverlight project ? be there hide overhead ? or be it a case of fear of auto magic on the part of the author ?
__label__anger	the follow code should show either the port or servername not both i always get both no matter what ? i have also try the follwoing with no joy either ! ! i just can not get the condition to resolve thanks in advance

__label__surprise __label__fear	omg i hope that be not all in #crd# file !
