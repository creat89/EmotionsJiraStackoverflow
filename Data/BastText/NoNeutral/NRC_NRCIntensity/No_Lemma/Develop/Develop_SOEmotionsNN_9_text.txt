__label__love __label__joy	would it be possible for you to post the code here ? that would be awesome !
__label__love __label__joy	works excellent ! ! thanks a lot guys ! ! !
__label__love __label__joy	excellent , the selected bit was very useful .
__label__love __label__joy	i did some research on this a few years ago ( i believe ) and i liked jnbridgepro as the best third party product to do this . check it out here good luck !
__label__love __label__joy	we added this snippet to localsettings . php , with great success : thanks !
__label__sadness	this is sad . and vcproj files have to be maintained by hand so the revision control system does n't whack it out .
__label__sadness	list comprehension performance link is dead ☹️
__label__sadness	it would be sad :(
__label__sadness	um … nothing … sad that we all missed the simple solution .
__label__sadness	i 'm afraid not , i ended up just removing some of the deeper folders to work around the issue - not ideal !
__label__sadness	have you tried removing ' preload ' attribute ? ( afraid i ca n't be much help otherwise ! )
__label__sadness	yeah , your pain is mine ! this method described by ctrahey at least gives you some clue .
__label__sadness	sorry to be a pain , but i have questions . ) but where is the log ? i assumed that it would be in $ ftpreturn . ) how do i check the bytes sent ?
__label__sadness	afraid not ! if i do so then it explicitly looks for quotes within the data , which it does n't have .
__label__sadness	that _ is _ sad news
__label__sadness	this makes me really sad .
__label__sadness	@maximilianböther i 'm sorry to hear that … maybe you can get in touch with the developers of baronreplays and ask them to help you out ? if not , i 'm afraid i can not help you much more ! regards , rodit
__label__sadness	very sad , for erlang programmers ☹️
__label__sadness	@aggieboy that 's really sad , and i have to hand - code stuff .
__label__sadness	i swear - i do n't put pseudo code i get told off for having bad variable names and things that do n't match … i put pseudocode and i still get grief !
__label__sadness	sad that you had to preface with " reasons for doing this aside " in order to prevent a flame war or such …
__label__joy	ok after a lot of searching i found the answer , which is relating to accessing request in django custom template tags … you can see the answer here : i used the following : and then changed the following line : i really hope this helps someone else ! 🙂
__label__joy	wow , wow , wow ! i actually found a better way to do that … if i keep the same abbreviation and change template text into : it does want i wanted , but in the way cooler way ! so you can use your own variables in a template as long as you do n't call them or awesome !
__label__joy	scss is not __ better __ than sass , just different . it all depends on how you are used to writing code . if you are used to haml - style terseness , then you could argue that sass is better ( less lines of code , less syntax like braces , etc ) . just pick your flavor and enjoy !
__label__joy	this works super for me ! ( no pun intended )
__label__joy	this is very fine 🙂 note that if you do the following : only the first element of the array will be initialized with the non-zero number whereas the rest will be initialized with zeros .
__label__joy	it 's a progress bar ! 🙂 setting makes it a rotating circle rather than a classic progress bar . there are several different styles you can use . play around with them to find the one you like 🙂 hope this helps !
__label__joy	i started wondering today if it would be possible to integrate joomla + cb with google apps . if that would be possible we could have one great product ! the first thing that i would want to integrate is the logon - process , one login for joomla + google apps . then it would be great to have some google apps modules : - your latest e-mails - your next calendar entries - your google talk buddies online / offline - your most recent docs and spreadsheets
__label__joy	was excellent 🙂 however instead of creating a button object , i am only calling an ontouchlistener to change the state of every view . gives the same results though
__label__joy	awesome 🙂 ! ! ! ! !
__label__joy	so through an incredibly awesome coding session i managed to extract all the variables on the first try . well , all checked out except for array since the pdf i tested on did n't have one in the aux info . all the data from cgpdfdictionaryref are now in an nsmutabledictionary , so its usable . tomorrow i 'll be making the second part to put it back into the other type that is needed , cfdictionaryref . so if you wanted to wait i 'll post it up .
__label__joy	works great !
__label__joy	what is the problem ? create additional page and add it to wp , insert code there , and make an output page whatever you want . if you know php it will take you min .
__label__joy	i hope you were joking 🙂 i want to collect general statistics on my typing and specifically not log everything since i 'm sure to type passwords .
__label__joy	😃 😃 😃 😃 😃 😃
__label__joy	my pleasure 🙂 🙂
__label__joy	in the absence of tuples , they 're sometimes the cleanest way to do things . i generally hate them , though . f # has some nice syntactical sugar for dealing with them . rather than making me deal with parameters , it treats them as methods that return tuples instead . the various methods end up returning two element tuples : it 's quite handy , and does n't make me feel dirty .
__label__joy	i have two namespaces : ) foo . bar ) another.foo.bar from a class in namespace , how do i reference a class in namespace ? using foo . bar leaves you in namespace still … i hope this is reasonably clear ! thanks .
__label__joy	i now get it why it is sometimes facetiously referred to as the " hollywood principle : do n't call us , we 'll call you "
__label__joy	if you handle the rowdatabound event you can check the value of the data and modify the attributes of the cell or apply a different style in that event handler . that should give you what you are looking for . let me know if you need it in vb rather than c # . good luck !
__label__joy	@drabjay : excellent suggestion ! code changed . 🙂
__label__joy	i have a table with a field that needs to store characters . my question is this : can you limit the length of a text field ( varchar stops at - i ca n't use it ) to characters ? if i do that , will mysql run through the table quicker due to the fixed data length , or does it act a bit like varchar in that the length can vary ? i do n't have a table ( at all ) yet , but i 'm very conscious about speed and size for the future . i found this article : incredibly useful - maybe you will to ! thanks a lot , james
__label__joy	point = > good luck but god love ya for tryin ' !
__label__joy	i used excellibrary with very great results ! ( until now it support excel or lower versions ) .
__label__joy	@thorbjã¸rn ravn andersen that 's really great !
__label__joy	i have a huge html form . i was wondering if it is possible to use notepad ++ to copy the text from value = " [ copy this ] " and paste it into id = " [ paste here ] " and for = " [ paste here ] " on every line . if anyone has the solution to this , every web developer out there will be very happy 😃 cheers !
__label__joy	if you are on 11g you are in luck 🙂 you can use select for update skip locked in the cursor - then you are guaranteed that two threads will never get the same row on a fetch ! the right way to do this in oracle would be advanced queueing - since this will solve all your problems , provides synchronization und parallel execution and other benefits….before oracle and without advanced queuing ( if you really want to code it yourself … ) you can do it like this :( the bits marked with autonomous transaction have to be called in a separate method as an autonomous transaction . if the update returns rows it can either be because the table is empty , or because two threads accessed the same row . - so we need a separate ending condition counting available rows .
__label__joy	great ! i will take a look later . cheers .
__label__joy	that 's a really cool functionality of php i did n't know about ! i 'm not exactly sure how i 'd actually _ use _ it , but that 's still cool !
__label__joy	here is some code to have a gif ( that already have transparency in it ) transformed ( supposed you want to resize it ) in bitmap and then can be showed properly with it 's transparency . good luck ! grã©goire lafortune
__label__joy	killed that process and restarted and it worked !
__label__joy	excellent . for some reason , data binding in winforms never jumps out at me as a solution no matter how much i use it in wpf.
__label__joy	excellent ! i 'll add it as an answer so you can close the question properly . glad i could help .
__label__fear	i 'm working on importing data from our application into oracle financials gl. it seems simple with the gl_interface table , and many resources online , but i do n't seem to understand it . i 'm looking for a simple way to post a transaction of $ x on a specific date , between or more accounts . i 'm terrified of incorrectly posting anything in the gl.
__label__fear	i want to change an image of an uiimageview from the applicationdidfinishlaunching method of the app delegate class . but i am afraid that this class does nt know much about the controller outlet . what must i do in this case ?
__label__fear	worried about ie compatibility ! !
__label__fear	i used multiple requests - batches of . i do n't want to anger the api !
__label__fear	i am trying to build an application that can request files from a service running on another machine in the network . these files can be fairly large ( 500mb + at times ) . i was looking into sending it via tcp but i 'm worried that it may require that the entire file be stored in memory . there will probably only be one client . copying to a shared directory is n't acceptable either . the only communication required is for the client to say " gim me xyz " and the server to send it ( and whatever it takes to ensure this happens correctly ) . any suggestions ?
__label__fear	i am also having this exact problem . large table , nested divs within table . firefox renders teh page within seconds , ie renders the table after a wait of minutes . firefox still zips along with teh drag and dtop , ie crawls … infact it freezes , and the drag and drop sdoes not work . am going to try some of teh solutions below . the fixed width , and the #id tagname . class references . but i do fear that it will still be slow . if anyone else has some good i deas , i would be all ears .
__label__fear	i 'm writing an eclipse plugin for the jdt. i need a functionality that tracks certain strings or regular expressions and possibly creates markers . i know that eclipse already does that for // todo comments , for example ( creating task markers for them ) but i 'm not sure if i can use the same mechanism . i can write my own but worried it would be too inefficient and not sensitive enough to code chnanges .
__label__love	i know i 've mentioned this several times before but scott meyer 's book [ effective stl ] ( http://www.amazon.com/effective-stl-addison-wesley-professional-computing/dp/ /ref=sr_11_1 ? ie = utf8 & qid = & sr = - ) covers these gotchas in a clear way .
__label__love	i 'm pretty new to vbs but i need to extract property information from web pages and input the information into excel . what i 'm trying to do is get is object information from links , text fields , buttons , images etc. the information i need is the . name , . id , . title , . value , . type , . class for each item on the page and display it together for each item ie : from the google search page the search box is . id : lst - ib , . name : q . title : search . type : text then the google button is . name : btnk . type : submit . value : google search etc etc. any help would be extremely helpful !
__label__love	excellent ! just what i needed !
__label__love	i solved this need by using . i am able to route calls from edge to my local machine . absolutely love ngork ! 🙂
__label__love	upvote for actually * answering * the question .
__label__love	i 've been experimenting with linq to see what it can do - and i 'm really loving it so far 🙂 i wrote some queries for an algorithm , but i did n't get the results i expected … the enumeration always returned empty : case # i changed the query declaration to be inline like this , and it worked fine : case # does anybody know why it does n't work in case # ? the way i understood it , the query was n't evaluated when you declared it , so i do n't see how there is a difference .
__label__love	wow i frickin love this site ! thanks for the quick and concise responses . i plan to keep the client - side regex validation but move the username check to the server - side on submit .
__label__love	that 's excellent ! please post it as an answer so i can accept it .
__label__love	wow ! truly awesome , sqlite to the power ! 🙂
__label__love	upvote saves a lot of time when unit testing data access layers . just note that ts will often need msdtc which might not be desirable ( depending on whether your app will need msdtc )
__label__love	excellent point , lars . i read that as " windows " . oops . still , it may be useful information for someone , sometime …
__label__love	thx for that , really great answer !
__label__love	a quick remark to the excellent answer by troy , if the version you downloaded is the newer one , , the quick nav has been remapped to ctrl + shift + q.
__label__love	@jball : upvote this is an example of the way ` . live ( ) ` is painfully abused .
__label__love	no worries ! ie11 does a poor job of emulating other browser versions .
__label__love	@vitoshka excellent ! wish i could give you another up vote for th update
__label__love	wow this is really awesome ! thanks for that @petert

__label__love	awesome ! thanks .
__label__love	i have a mobile web page with a table containing many rows . each row has additional information . ideally , when a user taps on each row , a new layer will display , covering the whole screen , that provides more information for each row . the layer can be closeable by tapping on the new layer itself . is this something i can do with a to begin with ? or do these rows need to be divs instead ? please if someone could push me along , that would be excellent ! thanks .
__label__love	excellent ! thanks 🙂

__label__love	wow , it works ! thanks .
__label__love	ya , indeed very good thinking for a teenager !
__label__love	excellent , thank you ! i do n't know when we are going to upgrade but that 's a good reason to i guess .
__label__love	your example files are well - formed xhtml. excellent ! this means you can use a simple xslt script . see
__label__love	if you are going to do minimal xaml stuff then the free and excellent tool kaxaml will help you . take a deep look here
__label__love	here 's the current code i am using . the above code works perfect in making vertical ( top to bottom ) gradients but i 'd like to be able to make horizontal ones as well . i have a very good understanding for php , but i do n't deal with php image functions very often . if someone can help me and figure this out i 'd really appreciate it !
__label__love	the is an excellent resource for locale data . from the website you can download an xml version of the database , which includes datetime formats , number formats , and lots of other locale specific data .
__label__love	thanks -- good answers . this is , in fact , a datetime type ; i had to typecast " stoptime " as : minor point . it works great !
__label__love	holy ( *&^ . i just looked at the jquery solution : add a hidden element to the dom containing every conceivable tag and then reverse engineer the geometry conventions . the web is truly amazing place !
__label__love	thanks . first method is really great !
__label__love	i just have to say this is a brilliant idea , love it ! upvote
__label__love	great answer - this code works like a charm on mac osx ! 🙂 doing a few settings up front removes code duplication when accessing settings from many places , see http://developer.qt.nokia.com/doc/qt- /qsettings.html#basic-usage
__label__love	excellent hint ! i was using scrollto ( , ) and it was doing nothing
__label__love	has an excellent in depth article on setting up an apache web server on a linux box . check out the article at the following link :
__label__love	hi derick - right now , i 'm running from the command line , and very soon we 'll have it hooked up to hudson . we 've convinced people that hudson will be fine without a physical log file from the rake execution . and i think i 've satiated the desire for log files by using the " . parameters " option on my msbuild and nunit tasks to log output . i 'm loving albacore ! you guys did a great job with it .
__label__love	excellent question . running a large project in successive version of python would n't be very definitive , unless you had , say , unit tests that magically achieved % code coverage , so a tool like this would be nice to have .
__label__love	great links , thanks for your work !
__label__love	excellent , now it 's working ! thank you very much for your help with this .
__label__love	can anyone help me to delete row of plist . here is , is , is and is . any help would be extremely appreciated 🙂
__label__love	i just use following code right now . the table is myisam 90mb . terms has fulltext index and it is varchar ( ) . there are rows on the table . i wonder if there is any solution which is more resource usage friendly than fulltext search on mysql ? especially in terms of memory . by saying solution , i refer to any solution such as other types of databases , table structures etc. and if the solution would be adaptable to a standart vps or hosting in general , it would be extremely super duper perfect ! thanks for your time !
__label__love	the paper is an excellent discussion on branching patterns such as the " main line " pattern you mention - it lists the options in the form of patterns together with discussion of anti-patterns . one of the authors is robert orenstein of perforce .
__label__love	thanks all for the great responses ! ! all of these worked

__label__love	i have two files . file : a fasta file with gene sequences , formated like this example : file : a simple text file with just the accession identification of the gene . like so . every entry in file is somewhere in file , but not every entry in file is in file . i need to remove all the entries from file that are not in file . i feel like there must be something in the biopython module that could help me , i just do n't know what . for instance , i originally thought that i could extract just the accessions from my fasta file using the function , but this really just lands me with two files of accession numbers . i do n't know how to selectively extract the accessions that are in the other file . maybe like reading all the entries from file into a dictionary and then associated that entry with its matching entry in file and use to extract the whole sequence….but i really do n't know….any help anyone could give me is extremely appreciated !
__label__love	how can i check if i have listed all the dependencies correctly ? the is an excellent tool for checking both build dependencies and dependencies by setting up a clean base system within a chroot environment . by compiling the package within pbuilder , you can easily check the build dependencies , and by testing it within a pbuilder environment , you can check the dependencies .
__label__love	ok this is really odd . i have a list of about pairs of tv 's that look like : etc , all the way up to they all work fine but one . it although the names and order of the tvs are correct in both the template and the resource its displays in the location . i have tried clearing both modx 's cache and my browser cache but here is the result i get : the template : the resource 's tv 's : the result on the browser : if anyone can give me a hint as to what 's going on i would be really greatful ! thanks
__label__love	upvote : excellent question 🙂
__label__love	i am designing a contact form which has a ' thank you ' message pop up on send , i need my thank you message to be positioned relative , other wise if the user happens to scroll while the animation is running the message remains stuck in place and ruins the animation . however positing the div relative keeps it in the position before it loads , what i need is a way to have the div display:none or opacity: before the send button is pressed , is that possible ? here is an to explain what i 'm trying to achieve a little better and below is the javascript i 'm using any help would be really appreciated 🙂 thanks guys !
__label__love	terrific answer ! this should be the accepted one .
__label__love	i am attempting to get just the smiling array under tags then attributes . i have tried both to search and simply select . every attempt results in an undefined variable . if you could explain how to select the smiling array that would be excellent !
__label__love	i have a few months of experience with ruby on rails and really loved it from the beginning on . now , for work , i was asked to code in grails and although i first had some objections , i now think it 's a very decent framework . one thing that really impressed me in grails are taglibs because they make frontend modularity so much easier . i would really like to do something with rails . is there anything like taglibs for rails ? if not , what are the best practices for accomplishing this kind of view modularity ( and , in essence , making my life easier ) ?
__label__love	i used for a medium sized project , and loved it . it 's incredibly feature - rich , has pretty good documentation , and an amazingly good support forum -- it 's one of those ones where you ask a question , and a guy who works for the company that produces the software almost invariably answers it within a few hours . i used it with php and mysql , but as far as i know it works with asp . net as well .
__label__love	yes , as a number of the excellent responses spotted , it is ( was ) a homebrew fiber implementation - my first implementation of flow - based programming on a pc. the - bit version was actually used for production work at a big us company . i did n't realize that win32 has a fibers implementation - i 'll read the article cited by greg hewgill . thanks to all of you !
__label__love	@alex : great 🙂 happy further coding !
__label__love	i would go with omnithreadlibrary , it 's very productive , btw. look at omnixml also , these libs are extremely helpful !
__label__love	awesome ! ! ! you just saved me a lot of work ! ! ! wish i could give more than just an upvote ! ! !
__label__love	you might want to look into jaxb . if you have a defined xml schema it will automatically create java classes that will easily allow you to ' marshal ' ( move data from java - > xml ) and much much more . it 's incredibly useful !
__label__love	i have a . dll file and the . lib file for it . the dll talks to an electronic key reader , and allows you to read / write the key id . this is the only documentation that comes with : i have never used dll before and really have no idea how i am supposed to use it in a c program . i really have no idea what do past this : if someone could show me an example how how to get devicepresent and how to use writekeyid i would be very greatful !
__label__love	i have a ruby script that goes and saves web pages from various sites , how do i make sure that it checks if the server can send gzipped files and saves them if available … any help would be great !
__label__love	very good question !
__label__love	a great explanation ! thanks :)
__label__love	i have a series of uiviews inside a uiscrollview , and the uiviewcontrollers for those views are not receiving the touch events . if i take the views out of the scroll view then it works . i have enabled userinteraction on the views but it 's still not working ! this must be possible and i 'd be really grateful if someone could point me in the right direction ! thanks , mike
__label__love	wow people thank you so much for your answers ! ! ! ! ( bow )
__label__love	amazingly useful - thanks a bunch , aleksandar !
__label__love	excellent solution ! this is the way to do it .
__label__love	how do you train neural network for pattern recognition ? for example a face recognition in a picture how would you define the output neurons ? ( eg . how to detect where is the face exactly , rather than just saying that there is a face in camera ) . also , how about detecting multiple faces and different size of faces ? if anyone could give me a pointer it would be really great cheers !
__label__surprise	i 'm surprised nobody has encountered this issue before . it seems very painful for any medium sized project and must be horrible for larger projects .
__label__surprise	something like this ? bonus . with the switch to you have readline editing capabilities , and tab completion on files . wooow !
__label__anger	i really hate putting variables in the view . i would change your helper to to " memoize " it , and just keep the three function calls .
__label__anger	all but one of the answers you got provide another frightening example of how people can get very basic c syntax wrong .
__label__anger	im working with vb in the form designer , trying to position some controls within a tab control . sometimes when i drag a control to position it , it gets placed on a different tab than the one i currently have selected and am working with . this is extremely annoying and seems to happen randomly . does anyone else ever have this issue ?
__label__anger	oh , i did not know that . as usual , ie comes out to be a pain in the a ** !
__label__anger	deleting files in xcode does not delete them from installed apps / build folders / etc. it 's extremely annoying . if you really want your app to only run in inch mode , delete the default- file and make sure to run clean / clean build folder in xcode , and delete the app completely off your simulator / device . it should start showing up letterboxed again . apple is still accepting in only submissions .
__label__anger	because the order by rand ( ) method is terrible for performance . note that he has rows in his table .
__label__anger	nearly everything coming out of redmond draws their menus differently then plain win32 menus . it really annoys me that this never makes into the os . os - level windows menus are so far out of date that drawing them yourself is nearly a requirement these days .
__label__anger	@crush oh man would that be painful to query on !
__label__anger	is defined on the document and you might not even have a variable ( it 's a property of , not of ) . change to but you must learn how to spot those bugs , by which lists errors . and using is a terribly painful way to track your bugs , use .
__label__anger	evil ! evil incarnate !
__label__anger	poor steve just got screwed over by people not reading what he wrote correctly . i hate it when that happens , but i can understand why they read it the way they did . you left the statement rather ambiguous .
__label__anger	official guide says : tomcat deployment is trivial and requires copying the war file into the tomcat_home / webapps folder and restarting the container . but this is really painful ☹️ does there any way to deploy app without restarting tomcat ?
__label__anger	avoid the auto method , to apply by hand is such painful ☹️
__label__anger	yes i 'm having the exact same issue , very annoying !
__label__anger	i am not familiar with python scripting . i am simply trying to create a small gui that will allow me to alter a parameter in an arcgis model using the tkinter scale and then run the model by clicking a tkinter button . ( the code below is not finished and is being used for testing purposes , hence the button does not actually call a different script yet ) . i get this typeerror in the traceback : i have tried deleting many different things from my code to determine what these arguments might be but to no avail . it is incredibly frustrating as i am sure it is the most simple problem . my code is as follows :
__label__anger	i have a password that i want to store as property in a web part that can be set via the tool pain . currently it is a string and can be clearly read . how would i go about making it * out ? if this is the wrong way to be doing this what would you advice to do instead ?
__label__anger	@njahnke : to me , it does not matter what they advise if they do not provide alternatives . i have been a happy user of qthttp thus far without worries , but yes , it is just a quick workaround as written .
__label__anger	can i fix the width and the height of jquerymobile dialog ? currently , the size of width is % which is really awful in ipad .
__label__anger	i 'm just going through the same process ! i was looking at this page : http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/connecting.html which starts talking about coffee shops ! at that point i gave up . you 've got to love java / oracle documentation !
__label__anger	i often need to execute custom sql queries in django , and manually converting query results into objects every time is kinda painful . i wonder how fellow slackers deal with this . maybe someone had written some kind of a library to help dealing with custom sql in django ?
__label__anger	i 'm trying to debug my application and from the point i fire it up on the ipad , it will get killed by timeout before it ever reaches finishedlaunching ( ) ( i have abreakpoint there ) ! here ' swhat i see in the output panel . all this takes almost 20s . if i run the app in release build it randomly gets stuck . i hit a button and the delegate gets caled half a minute later . what is going on ? in the simulator it is all okay .
__label__anger	i 'm having the exact same problem ! incredibly annoying !

__label__anger	i am looking to make a phone call from software and have the software read a message to the recipient . i have been using asterisk , but have found it somewhat are to maintain and it was a pain to configure . i 'm wondering if there are any services where you can send it a piece of text and a phone number and it will read it to the recipient of the phone call . i am in canada and making calls within canada . the service does not need to accept calls . i am working with an amp server .
__label__anger	good luck ! oci is incomprehensible .
__label__anger	writing a stream manipulator is a very complicated way of doing something very simple !
__label__anger	gah . parsing html with regexes . horrible horrible horrible .
__label__anger	ignoring how ridiculously lame it is to ask a question and answer it in this fashion seconds later , this is an awful answer , and that is why it is voted down . why will you only see a small speedup ? can you provide numbers ? platforms tested on ? this answer is even more vague than the original question , which was vague to begin with .
__label__anger	i have a big problem . i 've created site , using jquery , but it runs very slowly . on mobile phones it 's terrible ! and i do n't know , what 's wrong … someone can help me ? links does n't works yet , because i want use cms on this layout , but before i want to little optimise these scripts . here 's test site : and here are the scripts :
__label__anger	anyone have a graphical tool for developing mod_rewrite rules . ideally it would display a pipeline of rewrites and then when given an instance of a uri would show the transforms as the get applied . it 's always a pain to get them setup just right so any way of making it easier would help .
__label__anger	when i refactor the following line : using resharper 's " use object initializer " , i get the following : i really hate this type of formatting because with longer object names and variables it just gets out of control . how can i get resharper to do the following ?
__label__anger	off topic , but i really really hate the ` ` s in a row . that 's abuse !
__label__anger	or , just use stack overflow and let experts exchange die a slow and painful death .
__label__anger	jsps must not include any code that requires dependency injection . so do n't do it . if you really must , you can use but this is extremely ugly .
__label__anger	a module name is an , so it must normally start with a lowercase letter , unless you enclose it in single quotes . this is actually possible : but completely horrible , so do n't do this .
__label__anger	i have one of the microsoft keyboards with their function lock … man i hate that thing .
__label__anger	it 's technically possible to achieve this in t-sql with nested loops and embedded queries . all hugely ugly in t-sql . far easier to do it in a language that 's more general purpose .
__label__anger	horrible discovering ! ! ! !
__label__anger	is there a way to aid gmail in making threads ? we are currently using same subjects to do this , but that really uglyfies the subject a lot .
__label__anger	my experiences sound similar to yours . i 've only just started using doctrine , and have never used propel . however i am very disapointed in doctrine . it 's documentation is terrible . poorly organised , and quite incomplete .
__label__anger	i 've tried with postsharp , but their current implementation targets , and it 's getting painful to make it work . should i roll out my own aop implementation ( i 'm thinking of a very very basic and utilitarian implementation here ) or there is an alternative i 'm not aware of ?
__label__anger	so i hate xcode ! ! ! ! !
__label__anger	here is an incredibly disgusting way to do it : here is a better way ( i think ) : if you convert either output string with : you get your original number .
__label__anger	i want to duplicate a very large table , but i do not want to copy it row by row . is there a way to duplicate it ? for example , you can truncate w/o deleting row / row , so i was wondering if there is something similar for copying entire tables update : row by row insert is very painful ( because of m rows ) . anyway to avoid that ?
__label__anger	hate to break the bad news , but sshclient ( ) already uses threads internally .
__label__anger	is it not by default ? if yes , then it is really horrible …
__label__anger	just had this happen to me … very annoying ! i am using " pandora recovery " to try and restore the files , because i have no other backup .

__label__anger	i have a user control that i 've created , however when i go to add it to the xaml in the window , intellisense does n't pick it up , and i ca nt figure out how to add it to the window . i 'm pulling my hair out here ! any help is greatly appreciated !
__label__anger	@talnicolas i 'm using it a few dozen times in my class . it 's heavy to write , not easy to read and very painful to debug . i 'm sorry , i did n't think the question was that subjective , maybe someone should move it to programmers ! ?
__label__anger	this is simply the tip of the wtf iceberg i 'm exposing with this question . the rest of the app , and the purpose for its very existence is more painful , if you 'll believe it .
__label__anger	in theory , you could apply that philosophy to every single question on so . but it would be terribly boring to do so .
__label__anger	i need to perform the same hash server side . all this code that i am digging through seems to have been run through some compression tool . devastating .
__label__anger	unfortunately the smbios uuid is not unique on all systems . it should be but it is n't . this is not because of a failure in the specification of the smbios uuid , but is due to the fact that many manufacturers do n't follow the spec when creating this uuid . for more information about how this goes wrong in practice see this intel blog and the following instructive tale has some really awful examples from the real world : . by the way there is another more informative topic on stackoverflow about creating machine unique id 's at
__label__anger	this is a horrible solution . it will silently fail for floats . it also lacks parentheses .
__label__anger	i have an application where i need to adjust view position according to current focused subview ( it 's a list with focusable items , current focused item must be in the center of the screen - used for a tv application controlled from tv remote ) . position must be adjusted with animation . i got it working with just one problem : if the user changes focus before the animation is complete ( quickly taps " up " button twice ) next animation starts with " jump " - it starts from the same position as did the first one . so what i try to do is i cancel previous animation and start another , but then new animation starts from the point where first animation was started , so user can see a very obvious jumps in the animation , which look really awful . here 's the code : so must question is : how can i start translate animation from the point where previous translate animation left on ( assuming that it was cancelled ) ? or , in a simplier words , how can i determine current visible rect of a view ?
__label__anger	she records the class ( the computer screen shot ) but it 's very useless ! she confuses herself and the class …
__label__anger	its not quick to do , but you can also run fxcop , and it will alert you to objects that are idisposable that are nt in a using ( ) block . working on some legacy c # code here at work , i found that whoever wrote it orgininally actually made a " . dispose ( ) " method is almost every class , even if not needed , but the classes do n't actually implement idisposable . which means in intellisence they all have a dispose ( ) method , but ca n't be put in using ( ) blocks … very annoying !
__label__anger	now when i load it to the device , an image wo n't show up . this is all kinds of horrible !
__label__anger	now that 's a lousy , lousy way to answer a question . where do you do this ?
__label__anger	that 's some very dangerous advice !
__label__anger	that code is absolutely horrendous .
__label__anger	you could use an incredibly ugly workaround and set a form full of hidden fields to submit when you click a link . i really would n't recommended it though .
__label__anger	i am suffering from the problem in the first example - my enums do n't show up at all . this answer does n't even attempt to address that issue .
__label__anger	for sql server , i always had to install the full product first , then express second . if i did it the other way around , the full sql install would see express installed already , and would not continue with the install . it was extremely annoying . not sure if they fixed this with .
__label__anger	is there a way to set " work offline " in tfs without having to try opening a solution , waiting for it to time out , and then having visual studio work out that it has failed ? it seems a touch ridiculous that i ca n't just tick a box to tell it myself , seeing as i 'm probably the one most qualified to know when i 'm not in the office !
__label__anger	i 'm doing a fair bit of work in ruby recently , and using is absolutely critical . however , i 'm really disappointed with the default windows console in vista , especially in that there 's a really annoying bug where moving the cursor back when at the bottom of the screen irregularly causes it to jump back . anyone have a decent console app they use in windows ?
__label__anger	any progress on this one ? to embed complex functionality ( including history - aware interactivity ) on an mvc page without involving the rest of the page is a reasonable and common desire . the only alternative i see , to require the using page to track each components query - string state , is horrible .
__label__love __label__anger	xcode refactoring tools are pants ! up until you could only do renames , and not very well . they 're thrown a few more in the recent releases . intellij was excellent for refactoring - and now jetbrains have an xcode alternative : appcode - i 've tried it and it works great , and it has all the great refactoring tools i remember - and they work ! ca n't bring myself to leave xcode though - i like it .
