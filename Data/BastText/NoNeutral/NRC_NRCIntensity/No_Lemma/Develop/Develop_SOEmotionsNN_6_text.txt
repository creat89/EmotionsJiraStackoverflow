__label__sadness __label__fear	this code is scary ☹️
__label__love __label__anger	that 's the way i do it too . oracle 's create or replace is way better , i hate to repeat code .
__label__anger	more than ? how about more than or ? remembering the argument ordering in constructors is a real pain .
__label__anger	i guess that works , but i 'd never do that . it 's screaming bad practice . think about code readability etc … come back to your code in six months and figure out all the function calls inside your html markup .
__label__anger	so only workaround which works for me is to add this js to template of my site .. but its really awful solution , since i only need it in one article / module
__label__anger	that 's an awful lot of swapping hold and pattern spaces …
__label__anger	each tab in my xcode project can have navigation / debug / utility menus open . if i close those menus on one tab , then switch to the next , they may be open . this is really frustrating ! if i want the menus closed , i want them closed on all tabs . how can i change this behavior ?
__label__anger	regexes are fraught . a regex that splits parameters on commas will get awfully confused if one of the parameters is ` \ " hello , world ! \ " ` .
__label__anger	our qa team uses hp quality center for defect tracking , test plans , etc. the dev team really detests quality center and wants to use jira for internal task tracking . can these two systems work seamlessly together ? i have worked on projects where teams used separate issue - tracking systems and keeping them in sync was a major headache . anyone have real - world experience integrating quality center and jira ?
__label__anger	the problem is that " hello world " is a terrible example to use with tdd. you really need something that generates variable output based on variable input .
__label__anger	you are processing the newline character as if it is legitimate input . you should either read the entire line ( including the newline , perhaps using a ) and then process the first character of the line or simply add a test to skip newlines in your loop logic.p.s . converting case by adding or subtracting is a really awful approach . it wo n't work with anything but a-z and a-z ( in the english alphabet ) . it wo n't work for most characters outside the basic latin block and should n't be used at all for characters that have no alternate case ( such as newline ) . you should be using and instead .
__label__anger	i guess i could do that . it 's just a pain when in microsoft word i can hold down shift and drag to do this , but i ca n't in visual studio !
__label__anger	when i refactor the following line : using resharper 's " use object initializer " , i get the following : i really hate this type of formatting because with longer object names and variables it just gets out of control . how can i get resharper to do the following ?
__label__anger	com components are really a pain to manage , update , versioning , etc.
__label__anger	i currently have speakers set up both in my office and in my living room , connected to my pc via two sound cards , and would like to switch the set of speakers i 'm outputting to on the fly . anyone know an application or a windows api call that i can use to change the default sound output device ? it is currently a bit of a pain to traverse the existing control panel system .
__label__anger	its absurdly late / early so maybe i 'm just tired , but can anyone tell me why in the world the following test is not failing ? really need a second pair of eyes to confirm i 'm not crazy….now i 'm worried that all my tests are unreliable .
__label__anger	i really hate that object …
__label__anger	when querying from the database using entity framework , what exceptions should one catch and what should be done about them ? generally i use because i have no specific action or feedback for every possible type of error , but i am constantly reminded that this is a terrible idea and that specific exceptions should be caught and handled ! example : what are the standards / guidelines for handling ef exceptions ?
__label__anger	@wst it does n't even have the decency to return the same map ? that is really terrible .
__label__anger	this is extremely unsafe ! use ` mysqli ` or ` pdo ` instead of ` mysql _ ` .
__label__anger	the screen which shows whenever i start netbeans is very annoying , and among the hundreds of options i ca n't find the one which turns it off ?
__label__anger	the . net installation is one of the most painful setups of all history , in all means possible . i 've did many such setups and about half of them even * crashed * for xp.
__label__anger	how do i change the position of the sort button in header of the grid in tapestry ? i have column names of different lengths and i break lines on spaces , so the button , which is appended to the end of the column names , always ends up in different height . and that is very ugly ☹️
__label__anger	james , the stack trace under that is just my function name . nothing more . very frustrating ☹️
__label__anger	maybe someone knows how to disable content assist only on ' else ' keyword when working with php source editor in aptana ? as i really , really hate it with this keyword , because after newest release it 's really messing with my workflow as after entering ' else ' and pressing enter it replaces it with : and sometimes it decides to get rid of indents completely . mind you i do n't want to disable content assist completely , i just want to disable it for ' else ' keyword .
__label__anger	hi i 'm using the chrome inspector ( f12 ) to try and analyze the z - index of a twitter bootstrap popover , and finding it extremely frustrating … is there a way to freeze the popover ( while shown ) so that i can assess and modify the associated css ? placing a fixed ' hover ' on the associated link does not cause the popover to appear .
__label__anger	i had the problem that white was the " overscroll " color , not actually the fading edge . try this ( assuming you want a fading edge , but not the horrid white glare when you hit the ends ! ( otherwise set requires fading edge to none )) :
__label__anger	i ca n't help think that making xml ad xmllist both unrelated , as in both extend object directly , is a design flaw in the as3 core library . surely having xml extend xmllist would be a much cleaner system , where xml is considered an xmllist with only one member ? this would also avoid the very annoying practice of an e4x query possibly returning either an xml or xmllist , which can result in a casting error . so is there any reason i 'm not thinking of that xml and xmllist were designed to only have object as a common type ?
__label__anger	does a similar thing ( and yes , i find the ' pc ' moniker for windows machines very disgusting )
__label__anger	downvote for not explaining or giving details . i hate these types of questions !
__label__anger	i 've seen this bug in resharper . it happens when the base class is in the app_code directory . do n't know how to fix it , very annoying , code still compiles though .
__label__anger	i use the gem for transparent usage of memcached . using the supplied config file it is enabled on all modes ( development , test , production ) . is there a way to only activate cache - money in production mode ? it 's not immediately clear how to do this , and it 's a total pain dealing with caching in development mode .
__label__anger	alan , i assume some people already hate you just for asking . and they have a point .
__label__anger	this is very strange , what are you trying to do here . it looks very scary code . where are your constructors ?
__label__anger	the error occurs because is looking in the wrong environment ( i.e. , not inside the data frame ) . you could explicitly specify the but that would be ugly , awful code . much better to use as iselzer suggests .
__label__anger	no , unless there 's a relevant ie zero day . obviously , this would be a huge abuse of user privacy ( if you want their name , ask them ! ) .
__label__anger	i hate dev - c ++ but because of a library , i have to use it ! ! ! what 's the matter for dev - c ++ or are there errors in my code about using referance variable ? error : c:***\main.c syntax error before ' & ' token
__label__anger	when running graphics based programs in python for s60 ( pys60 ) the error messages and the output of the print statement ( i.e. stdout ) are hidden . if due to an error application stops working as expected its lost and tracking down the bug is very difficult , sometimes require running a " second stripped version " of the code . this is obviously painful . how do i log those errors to a file , so that i may see them later .
__label__anger	because it is terribly difficult to get right . but i mention ` boost::iterator_facade ` .
__label__anger	i have a bufferedwriter to which i use to write characters into a pipedinputstream . based on keyboard events . but i am implementing a backspace handler , but i can see no way of doing so without unputc . i am almost falling back into using a string to buffer the current line . perhaps , i could do a better job using canvas instead . ( god how i hate java ! )
__label__anger	@rob same problem , nothing . very disgusting
__label__anger	i am working on a test application based on asp . net mvc. i am new to css stuff so i am learning that as well . i have created a master page called " new . master " and created a new css " new . css " . i am calling the view from controller as : what i am doing is that i am frequently updating the css and master page . so i run the application in debug mode frequently . after sometime i stop seeing the effect of changes in css. when i " view source " in chrome and check the css , it shows an old version . when i change the name of both master page and css , i start to receive updated views but that works for sometime and then again i stop getting the css updates . have you faced this problem ? how can i fix it ? ( its terribly annoying ! )
__label__anger	i have a table that is referenced by a ton of other tables via foreign keys . i am trying to delete a document record , and according to my execution plan , sql server is doing a clustered index scan on every one of the referencing tables . this is very painful . i thought having a fk automatically made an index on the fk fields ? or am i wrong ? do i really have to go around my database putting an explicit index on every single fk field ?
__label__anger	we have a - tier web application written in asp . net webforms where we will not be able to port it - recession really sucks ! - to mvc. our goal is to implement a plugin architecture . one way would be to use the app_code folder . are there any better alternatives ?
__label__anger	for various reasons microsoft decides that some info should be kept away from developers . but people through reverse engineering find out what these reserved fields are about and produce their own documentation . some times people guess correct . some times microsoft makes breaking changes , and people scream " how dare you ! " . and life goes on .
__label__anger	how come this is considered programming related ?
__label__anger	im trying to work with this awful language and i have to change an item of list by accessing to it with index i do nt understand the awful syntax of tcl ! how can i realise it ?
__label__anger	this is how i would do it … i really hate javascript popups …
__label__anger	in my android app i 'm trying to share an open graph including an object and an action . in my facebook app i added a story : and ( is this ok ? ) . when i try to add an image to the object in the og i get above error . this is my code : here 's the logcat : what am i doing wrong ? maybe i 'm messing up some strings in the story , facebook tutorial is awful !
__label__anger	actually it 's not as bad as it looks - perl 's file::copy is horribly broken ( for example it does n't copy file permission on unix and other stuff ) , so many " high profile " hackers actually use system ( 'cp ' , $ target , $ destination ) or similar stuff
__label__anger	you forgot regression tests - it is a real pain for a manual tester to run through hundreds of forms just to check for some basic stuff which could be easier done automatic . better spare the tester this tedious stuff , so he can concentrate on the nasty testing .
__label__anger	when i slide to a next image , or when the slider / carousel automatically switches to the next image the previous image disapears too fast , which gives it an extremely ugly look . i 've made a video to make clear what i mean , can be checked over here . anyone has an idea ? code for the carousel :
__label__anger	i hate it none of the specified answers worked for me …
__label__anger	in bash , you use parameter expansion : in your case , say . no need to go overboard and cry for regexes at the slightest provocation -- bash has plenty of power !
__label__anger	this is how you find the arc length given the parameter , but finding equidistant points requires the inverse of this function . getting from one to the other is not trivial . @christian romo : how did you do it ? i mean , you can just use binary search , but that would be horribly slow ( for what i 'm trying to do , anyway ) .
__label__anger	i really hate regex in principle . can it be done in a plane script or something ?
__label__anger	the following code to use results in black image no capture , why ? note that adding before capture has no effect ! googling has been completely useless for this case , so far !
__label__anger	wide lines are a #@$# in most diff'ing tools as well , which can make code reviews a pain .
__label__anger	is there any way to have a statement across multiple lines without the underscore character ? it is really annoying in multi-line strings such as sql statements , and especially linq queries . beside from the ugliness and difficulty when changing a line ( nothing lines up anymore ) you ca n't use comments in the middle of the multi-line statement . examples of my daily personal hell .
__label__anger	i found this code ( full version here ) it 's work for me but now i do n't know how to stop it ( for making test it 's horrible , my new php file not interpreted ! )
__label__anger	is it possible to hide . svn files in the open resource dialog ( ctrl + shift + r ) of eclipse ? it 's very annoying when you have hundreds of files … cheers .
__label__anger	well asp . net is problematic by itself in many ways . i can only imagine how the page is coded , but mostly asp . net submits are done in a very painful way through _ dopostback where it sets additional hidden fields . you might want to try reading this and reviewing the generated html of the page
__label__anger	i 'm working on a huge application and the extra steps you mentioned were really pain in the ass for me . so i developed a small proxy class that handles class method bindings . first i 've added a small proxy class then added a category accessor to nsapplication ( i actually added this to my application delegate and implemented ) now you are ready to bind class methods to the application object , even in the interface builder , with the keypath .
__label__anger	this will compile a regular expression that matches one or more this opens the file located at for reading , assigning the subsequent file object to the variable the function of file objects returns a list of the lines of the object . it is exactly identical to on systems that use as a newline . ( windows typically uses ) this splits the first element of ( ) including everything but the last element ( ) on the regex you defined earlier ( that , again , catches all - > ) note that this is really awful code . there 's no reason to use a regex here , and using when you 're only looking for the first line is kind of like building an engine so you know what the spark plugs look like . this is better :
__label__anger	is it possible to prevent a user from editing the title of a node on the node edit screen ? one of the things i really detest about drupal is the rigidity of the title & body field in each node .
__label__anger	work - around ( horrible horrible invasive work - around ) i got around this by subclassing uiapplication to track all screen touches . by holding on to the last touch location , i can , in the delegate , map the location to the link to determine whether or not it should be considered valid : mycustomapplication.m ( use it in main.m ) and map it …
__label__anger	i am working with eclipse ( indigo ) to develop c projects . when i create a new c project in a new workspace , by default the " autosave before build " option is not set . this is extremely frustrating , as autosave is usually the default behavior in other ide 's i worked on . i change some code , build and nothing seems to go as expected - until i remember that the option is not set … is there a way to make eclipse open a new workspace with this option set ?
__label__anger	enumerating all partitions of a set is . now , all permutations of all partitions of a set will be , although the example is a bit artificial . now , to come up with a useful algorithm it 's a totally different story . i am not aware of any such algorithm , and in any case its scaling will be absolutely awful .
__label__anger	trying to get s60 sdk working on linux is quite a pain . still struggling with that .
__label__anger	these will not jump : they are , however , soul destroying and extremely ugly .
__label__surprise	oh , yea , did n't notice , answers below this one are at most half a year old .
__label__surprise	projects ! wow ! well i can see that happening for what you do …
__label__love	that 's super great ! @joshuanozzi thanks ! ! !
__label__love	loved your line nsindexpath * indexpath = [ nsindexpath indexpathforrow: insection: ] ; . upvote for you 😉
__label__love	loved this solution !
__label__love	as mentioned above , some of the fundamental object oriented design principles are ocp , lsp , dip and isp . an excellent overview of these by robert c. martin ( of object mentor ) is available here :
__label__love	an excellent ` pushd` / `popd ` installation appears [ here ] ( http://blogs.oracle.com/nico/entry/ksh_functions_galore) in one of oracle 's blogs - presumably relating to its use in solaris .
__label__love	excellent ! ! ! this is exactly what i am looking for !
__label__love	i really love anonymous inner classes …
__label__love	oh ! excellent ! ! worked like a charm !
__label__love	@calebhuitt - cjhuitt : excellent â € ” that works ! thank you very much . if you 'd like some brownie points , please submit it as an answer and i 'll mark it as the correct answer .
__label__love	i know techsmith has a screen recorder api called that you can access programatically . i have n't used it , but i 've used the snagit api by the same company and it 's excellent .
__label__love	this is gorgeous !
__label__love	excellent - now if i set the main imageview layout_weight to and the inner linearlayout to , i get the / effect i wanted too ! thanks kevin !
__label__love	have you actually implemented this successfully ? it sounds like a great solution !
__label__love	@r … , excellent reading , many thanks ! 😃
__label__love	@andrewlazarus - excellent point ! !
__label__love	i tried pekwm for some time . i really liked it . it allowed me to group programs of the same type , for example : terminals .
__label__love	use web essentials … it works really great , and has lots of other useful tidbits !
__label__love	i 'm worndering how i can add rows , of which depends on another , in transaction . reason i an doing is that the library i 'm using does not return the rowid , and i need to commit the transaction as less as possible as i 'm adding over a few million records ! just for the record i 'm using : sql server python pyodbc any idea ? would be really awesome 🙂
__label__love	great tutorial . really appreciate it !
__label__love	if it has a lot of cup holders , that 'd be awesome , too !
__label__love	i 'm using mongomapper and am trying to come up with a way to use an abbreviated field name . i want to keep the keys as plain english but have the field names stored short ( e.g. " name " maps to " _ n " ) . i noticed a conversation but it ended up closed ( ) and i was wondering if anybody has an example of how to accomplish this . i 'd be extremely grateful for any feedback !
__label__love	i have a file containing unsigned bit integers in little endian format shown below i 'm looking for a way to read these numbers in and then convert them to their decimal equivilant the code i have so far is as follows : which gives me the following output from the first number i 've been looking at how to use structs for this as it seems like it is what it was made for but i 've been unable to find the correct syntax using them . any help would be hugely appreciated !
__label__love	i have two classes , a gui and a customer class . the gui builds the frame and button , and the customer class gets the info from a database server . i have the actionperformed in the customer class , but it does n't appear to be noticing when i click the button . any help is extremely appreciated ! gui class : customer class :
__label__love	almost works . you have to seek to one less then write a byte , otherwise you still end up with a 0b file . still very helpful , thanks ! correct syntax too . if you want to edit , the extra line you need is outfile . writebyte ( ) ;
__label__love	excellent ! i 'll try that . hmm … i ca nt upvote yet , otherwise i would have 🙂

__label__love	an alternative to recording would be to use the ms speech api with c # , enter the words via keyboard , and have it state what was keyed in. just a thought … good luck on your app -- it sounds like a really cool program !
__label__love	great question ! ! i 'm hoping to use something like migrations with django too .

__label__love	no worries man !
__label__love	i found an excellent tutorial on how to create site columns and content types - here : ( thanks again rob ! ) does anyone know of a written or video tutorial that will explain how to create a list and list instance in moss . i use wsp builder , and the build in templates from microsoft are n't compatible ( or up to the task ) . preferably a method that focuses on the caml ( xml ) , and explains in detail the theory , and demonstrates how it is done . thank you .
__label__love	works excellent , many thanks !
__label__love	very direct question , i need to know if its possible and maybe where to start reading about that . im a programmer with zero experience in windows servers and a client is asking if we can deliver in their windows boxes ( and no they wo nt let us use any kind of virtualization in them ) . thanks guys , i know its not % programming related but … hope you can help 🙂 edit : wow , fast reply ! thanks guys ! ! !
__label__love	try this : if you are really finding yourself getting interested in spritekit , then i suggest you expand your knowledge with some excellent tutorials . this will make your experience a lot less frustrating and put you on the road to becoming the next angry birds creator ! take a look at the tutorials on this site http://www.raywenderlich.com

__label__love	how come this does n't work ( operating on an empty select list but this does : replace : var dropdownlist = $ ( " #requesttypes " ) ; with plain old javascript : var dropdownlist = document . getelementbyid ( " requesttypes " ) ; any insights greatly appreciated ! !
__label__love	i knew about the _ viemurc / .viemurc file , but i did n't realize you could map commands to vs ones with vsc. very good tip !
__label__love	this is answered . the concept was implementing with the tags such as and within the and div. excellent answer !
__label__love	ryan oberoi makes an excellent suggestion , but it 's a bit overkill for my small asp . net mvc web application . i like lobstrosity 's idea since it could apply to any class tag and its short and simple … just what i need . both are good answers yet one solves the general question ( involving a css framework ) and the other one solves my specific need … i guess i should select ryan 's response as the solution as it would probably help others more … any suggestions ?
__label__love	here are my tables . and here are my object classes i 'm brand new to dapper and orm in general , so please bare with me . would a many - to - many relationship be possible to map out with dapper ? if so , could someone provide a coding sample , that would be extremely helpful ! i am also open to switching to a heavier orm if that would make these advanced mapping scenarios a lot simpler .
__label__love	#error !
__label__love	i have a xml similar to this one : the thing is , im able to get all the info tags , but i get the results from all dates . i do nt know what the dates will be , since the are dynamic generated . what i know is that i may have a data tag with one or two date tags i wish i could show the first dateâ´s info on a list box and the second dateâ´s info on another listbox . how can i do that ? desirable output : if thereâ´s a second date then print it too : thx !
__label__love	first : i like your approach of being concentrated on a clean and proper state handling of your application . excellent ! but , as you said : android can kill activities and manage their lifecycle for itself . the os may release memory allocated for your activity as soon as possible requiring you to allocate it again . this means your fragment may or may not get destroyed . as you can see in your stack trace , fragmentactivity . oncreate is called . this obviously inddicates your existing resources created within the context of the old activity are not access - able anymore . the only context that is guaranted to exist through your application lifecycle is the application context . for all other resources you should be aware and handle properly that created resources may be invalid at the time you are trying to access them .
__label__love	i would like to strip everything in a string before a - and leave what 's after that . for example : - i want to strip and leave . i 've tried a few different things , but ca n't seem to get it working , if anyone could help me out , that 'd be fantastic 🙂 cheers leanne

__label__love	i absolutely * love * your title ! but your question will need some more details if you need some help . do you have any code you 've tried ?
__label__love	well , again thanks for your help , it works very great ! have a nice day 🙂
__label__love	i ca n't get any event triggers to work . a simplified example of what i 'm doing is below - i know there is a event on border since it is defined in but i 'm still getting can not convert string ' mouseenter ' in attribute ' routedevent ' to object of type ' system.windows.routedevent ' as soon as i run the application . any help would be hugely appreciated .
__label__love	i think that solution is now ready . here 's the code : david wasser you are extremely helpful , thanks !
__label__love	oh , but [ requests ] ( http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html) * is * especially great . imho
__label__love	like others i 'm using larger fonts , since getting on the plus side of fifty . most recently i started using the consolas typeface and have really enjoyed it . fixed width indents well . the clear differences between lowercase l and number and the letter o and zeronumber for example also makes this a really good programming font .
__label__love	your implementation looks absolutely fine to me ! a range - based away subscript is a type for performance reasons . it does not copy the indicated sub-array , instead it just points to the range defined by the you provide to the subscript .
__label__love	that 's a great link ! donut caching , when using the webformviewengine also works with the declarative control too .
__label__love	so i 'm trying to write a rr rotation and ll rotation with java for an avl tree . i have most of it figured out , however i do n't know where i should modify the height within the method . i 've been trying to understand it for a few days here but i can not figure out where exactly it would go in the method i currently have . if someone could help explain exactly where i should put the modifications for the height of the node ( it uses getleft / setleft for it 's left height and getright / setright for it 's right height ) it would be extremely helpful !
__label__love	thanks dana -- that 's really great ! any way to add a slider to control zoom level ?
__label__love	in vs , there are xml code snippets that seem to be pretty awesome 🙂 however , it seems that the snippets we created do not indent properly . for example if we have the following code : we get something like : is there any way to make it so that all lines keep the same indentation ?
__label__love	i am using opencart . i would like an order confirmation email sent to the regional sales representative when an order is placed in their region … such as west of the mississippi . i thought it might be possible through geozones ? but i have n't figured out a way to do it . i have been researching this for days … any suggestions would be hugely appreciated ! thanks in advance .
__label__love	upvote for calling out the binding method .
__label__love	i 've done much searching on this and ca n't seem to find an example that helps my case . i have an array like so : what i am trying to achieve is a new array with grouping like the following : any pointers would me hugely appreciated !
__label__love	i have a piece of json string , which i want to parse in erlang . it looks like : i looked at mochijson2 , and a couple of other json parsers , but i really could not figure out how to do it . any help greatly appreciated !
__label__love	excellent answer 🙂
__label__fear	out of all that pseudocode , the only thing that really worries me is " extracts code samples from file " . reading files from a directory is trivial , saving a file is trivial . regardless of the test framework i 'd spend most of my time focusing on the parsing bit . for direct testing , i 'd embed the snippets directly into the test case : ah , i see another change i subtly made while writing the test : my examplestocode . parse ( ) returns an array ( or other iterable container ) , so that it can be tested apart from the iteration itself .
__label__fear	after installing node , fresh installation of yeoman throws several warnings . command warnings i am not sure , whether i should be worried about these warnings or just ignore them ! either ways i want to understand the reason behind getting these warnings .
__label__fear	exactly why i 'm asking because that s what i fear !
__label__fear	a colleague recently asked me how to deep - clone a map and i realized that i probably have never used the clone ( ) method - which worries me . what are the most common scenarios you have found where you need to clone an object ?
__label__fear	i 'm afraid you can not fetch that ! the graph api do n't provide any api to do so .
__label__fear	` logger logger = new logger . getlogger ` - i 'd be more worried about the impending logpocalypse !
__label__fear	oh , i am scared !
__label__anger __label__sadness	i have a serious problem which i ca n't a solution to . i need to authenticate a token in order to let the user login into my app , the problem is that even though i 'm using the asynctask , and probably because of it , i ca n't authenticate it in time . other problem that sometimes accurs is that i get the networkonmainthreadexception error … i 'm really hopeless . here 's the flow - and here 's my code - that 's is the urldownloader class -
__label__joy	great ! i 'm glad you like it .
__label__joy	hi i just started playing with mongoose . it seems pretty awesome ! now coming from a django background , how would one implement a type of options field like : so that it can be set like status = open or something like that . or should this just be a normal string field and i set it accordingly in my app ?
__label__joy	there are two issues with your regex pattern : firstly , you forgot to add the ^ at the beginning . this is why only the last characters were checked , or to say : you did not check the entire input . secondly , your cyrill check did not seem to be correct . still , i am not used to cyrillic letters and i should be careful before i judge 😉 hope it helps !
__label__joy	maybe this will be of some help -
__label__joy	you should . it has a lot of good packages . i found these packages to help you with zip files for example : the npm registry is really amazing 🙂
__label__joy	here 's the king daddy of database wiping scripts . it will clear all tables and reseed them correctly : enjoy , but be careful !
__label__joy	got it : i need to reference the class types through the createjs module . i.e. works absolutely fine !
__label__joy	updated the answer . this might help you ! great ! then you might want to edit the java program and have the permission specified while the folder is created did you try chmod with permission via terminal or php ?
__label__joy	i ca n't find anything on google . this question is the last hope !
__label__joy	i 've been using the jquery ui calendar / date picker with great success over the last couple months . i 've been given a new requirement to allow for a week to be selected ( sun - sat ) rather than a single day . has anyone accomplished this before ? highlighting by week rather than day show beginning date and ending date rather than single date in textbox / labels
__label__joy	agile development ca n't be sold using documentations . instead , ask your management to let you be agile on a small pilot projet . for this pilot project , you must : - find a motivated end user to help you . - be free not to use the standard developping processes of your company . then , succeed ! ! !
__label__joy	this worked for me .
__label__joy	hope it works , if you can upvote my answer i 'd really appreciate it ! 🙂
__label__joy	i stumbled upon this site and really loved the way they have done the navigation on the left hand site . i noticed that site is using jquery but did nt see any plugins . any ideas on how to go about doing this ?
__label__joy	you are very welcome ! learn programming , it 's a lot of fun !
__label__joy	good luck with your image processing adventures ! i found it very fulfilling on a technical level when i was in that area 🙂
__label__joy	goooooooooooooood !
__label__joy	i would use ! to get everything with tag just do : to get the value inside of span you could do : there are tons of differnt methods of getting the informaton you need good luck hope this helps !
__label__joy	🙂 🙂 🙂 🙂 🙂 🙂
__label__joy	god , that was terrible ; i left the link to my library as the one i use for my own server . should work now … : ) and , pim , they 're not entirely random ; the library 's for my own personal use , so i tend to just pick letters that make sense to me : [r] eturn , [s] teps , [g] radient , [f] ade count …
__label__joy	if this is true that 's excellent news ! i 'll give it a try next app update …
__label__joy	not for my company , so i do n't have to worry 😉
__label__joy	ah , million is a much less scary number !
__label__joy	i figured out , way of calling the hub was not correct . for the time being i have modified my code as in global . asax :- works absolutely fine now 🙂 still figuring out better alternatives ! ! ! !
__label__joy	i 'm really glad it worked ! btw , the best way to show appreciation on stack overflow if someone helps to solve your problem is to upvote their answer and mark it as solved 🙂
__label__joy	wrote it down for you , hope it works as you expected !
__label__joy	it proved the point . they are very excited about so now .
__label__joy	no worries , just run some tests and see what fits better your usecase !
__label__joy	did you run out of variable names ? 😉
__label__joy	wow , i 've just had a look at the corona sdk. it looks excellent ! a really intuitive way to build apps . thanks for the tip !
__label__joy	agree that you should ensure that your data is properly indexed . apart from that , if you are worried about table size , you can always implement some type of data archival strategy to later down the line . do n't worry too much about this until you see problems cropping up , and do n't optimise prematurely .
__label__joy	for all your keydown / keyup / keyboard needs , use the jquery hotkeys plugin . saw this a few months ago and it never fails to impress it . follow the jump for the plugin demo ... it maps all keys on a keyboard including combos . hope it helps !
__label__love __label__joy	i have a script in which i need to process a file using ajax . everything in the script works , except i can not get the right variable . i have tried everything and i currently have this in its place i was wondering if anyone could tell me how to successfully set whatever is in this field as a variable in the ajax script that i have . all help is extremely appreciated , thanks for the help !
__label__love __label__joy	i have set up the gravatar ror plugin successfully ( yeah ! ) but when someone does not have a gravatar account , i want it to display the identicon , which i guess shows up when d = identicon in the gravatar url….but since i am using the plugin , i am basically saying gravatar_for ( user ) so….is there a way to add that value ? thanks !
__label__love __label__joy	nice ! i love the video software ! lol . had to download it . anyway , i fixed the open modal , i did n't fix teh fixed modal . i 'll get back to you in a minute
__label__love __label__joy	great time saver and hidden gem . excellent !
__label__love __label__joy	@bober02 if u are in this industry sooner or later you will " meet " martin thompson 's excellent blog , i 'm glad to introduce you to it . 🙂 http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/ / /memory-barriersfences.html happy reading !
__label__sadness	is packed - decimal part of the ebcdic format , or is this just a file which happens to use both ? i 'm not familiar with that format , i 'm afraid ☹️
__label__sadness	i 've updated the fiddle . i had to use classes to get it to work , so its not % perfect imo .
__label__sadness	if it 's forms auth then yes , that 's weird . i 'm afraid i do n't have any idea !
__label__sadness	i 'm afraid i ca n't really accept an answer here as it turns out that it ca n't really be done , without using a workaround , which i did n't want to do . sorry !
__label__sadness	i am sorry to say this but most silverlight grids do not support cell merging . at least not out of the box . i have resorted to using component one studio for silverlight in order to achieve this , and even then it has n't been exactly a walk in the park . consider c1 data grid control . here is a sample on with sample code and a small write up . the down side of such solutions is that c1's controls are extremely expensive ☹️ i wish micro$oft came up with some enhancements in sl5 that would accommodate for such issues .
__label__sadness	perhaps i am missing something , but i am just learning javascript . my understanding of single origin policy is that google analytics should not be able to send data back to google . how is it able to transmit send data to google without violating the policy ?
__label__sadness	that 's depressing 😕 are you sure i ca n't get a collection of all controls on the page with a particular class and give them a single data source ?
__label__sadness	right ... if only i was using sql server … informix unfortunately ☹️ ☹️ ☹️
__label__sadness	not sure this answers the question accurately , what does everyone else think ?
__label__sadness	that 's really sad …
__label__sadness	* oh so very sad * ☹️
__label__sadness	my guess is that you would have to extend the classes for datatip , to check for null hitdata objects , to kill / stop the drawing of the display . i do not think there is a way to do that normally in flex . you would have to customize and override the hitdata class unfortunately . what a pain ! !
__label__sadness	its really sad ☹️ to hear " we can n't fix footer or header view " .. it always get scroll with rows .
__label__sadness	that 's terrible ☹️
__label__sadness	it 's very painful to add multiple tickets to trac or to have it as your own todo list . that causes people to use their own task management tools so tasks are then spread all around . is there any plugin or macro that would quicken the process of adding a ticket ?
__label__sadness	i 'm not for sure how the controlcollection of asp . net works , so maybe someone can shed some light on this for me . i recently discovered the magic that is extension methods and linq . well , i was very sad to find that this is n't valid syntax however from what i can tell , does implement the interface which provides such methods , so what gives ? why does n't that just work ? i have found a decent work around for this issue at least :
