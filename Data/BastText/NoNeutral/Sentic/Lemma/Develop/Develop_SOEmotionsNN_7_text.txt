__label__anger	ok , here 's #crd# way of do this , but it 's terrible ! i be still look for an easy way :
__label__anger	this be not worthy of an " answer " , but i think i would mention : many of the interface i have really enjoy have be minimalistic -- there 's almost nothing for me to see . like quicksilver for os x.
__label__anger	( for the record , i find the infragistics winforms control to be considerably easy than their asp . net control . i think a lot of their bad rep come from the asp . net side of the world , where certain task become a major pain and their viewstate usage be off the chart . )
__label__anger	i do not want to do anything fancy on twitter except post to it via my site once a day . i have search around a bit and there be all sort of super-complex way to do every little thing that twitter do , but there seem to be little documentation on how to do the simple thing , which be make a post ! do anyone know how to do this ? or can you at least point me in the right direction ? i do not need full wrapper or anything ( ) , just #crd# simple function that will post to twitter . thanks !
__label__anger	currently make a java program that grab datum off of a msaccess database and some of these error be extremely frustrating . i keep get this sql . exception : too few parameter . expect error on the last remain bug in this program . little background on the db : it have table ( a player table ( column ) , a team table ( column ) , and an opponent table ( column ) . these be both of the function and i be fairly certain the problem lie in here somewhere or this function

__label__anger	i will #ord# the ni measurement studio . i have plot point / sec with ni measurement studio 's chart control . also , this test be do on a laptop with a very lousy video card . afaik , measurement studio be use opengl internally .
__label__anger	i see microsoft be still at it with their horrible magic version control stuff ‚Ä¶
__label__anger	somewhat new to oop ( i.e. c programmer convert to c ++ ) and can not figure out why my datum member in my backpack class be empty . i make pass an array of potion to my backpack , yet the datum member be say mtype = "" ( i.e. nothing ) . i have never feel this lose in a program before . start to hate oop ( i.e. kidding‚Ä¶.but this extremely frustrating ) . main . cpp potion . cpp backpack . cpp
__label__anger	be not an , it 's a basic type . you can only add nsobject - derive object to an nsarray . the exc_bad_access be probably because , under the cover , it 's try to access an object store at wherever your int be point to . in other word , it 's use your int as a pointer to an nsobject and fail horribly when it do so .
__label__anger	i be run into extremely frustrating problem with boost . when i try run something as simple as i get back : why be this error occur , and how do i make boost . lambda do what i need ? ( yes , i be aware i can use boost . phoenix et al. too , but that 's not the point of the question . )
__label__anger	i be try to change a bit - map 's pixel color if it 's white . i write follow code . but it 's awfully slow ! . i want to check if a pixel 's color be white or not , and if it be white , change the color to black . can anybody suggest a good approach ?
__label__anger	@augustss : with ` impredicativetypes ` you can make monadic bind polymorphic as well ( though it require a heck lot of extremely ugly type annotation ) .
__label__anger	get a spite downvote , it 's still a valid question .
__label__anger	for c # visual studio use space by default , whereas for c ++ it be hard - tab . why be it so ? why be it different ? my project consist of both c # and c ++ code and the difference really annoy me . i want to set a common standard for all the source , but i wonder if this would have any drawback .
__label__anger	i know it 's just example code , but i really hope your ` manager ` and ` staff ` class name be not really low - case !
__label__anger	it 's a very painful process to ajax ` file ` to a server side script . you might try : #hlink#
__label__anger	anti-javascript snobbery ! every language use a separate platform on some level to parse and execute the code . javascript be just another language , capable of write " program " or " script " .
__label__anger	that be a terrible article , it start out right , fisher - yates / knuth shuffle , then go horribly wrong by try to randomly order use guid as a source of randomness . do not waste your time and just read the wikipedia article on fisher - yates or use a library that implement shuffle correctly .
__label__anger	absolutely terrible ! ! ! it be not dependecy injection
__label__anger	so im use a simple submit bind to pass a function datum : i just start work with ko so i be to write a basic print function to test this input out : my problem be when i hit submit i get a " you enter : undefined " but when i refresh the page the input that be in the form get an alert . this be very frustrating ! idk if this be a knockout problem or a simple html #crd# .
__label__anger	stylereports be #crd# of the most heinous toolsuites i have ever have to use .
__label__anger	oh , man , i be sorry but i must say it : your code be really awful ‚Ä¶ it be not organize at all , but maybe ‚Ä¶ should not be instead ? edit : try to comment the #ord# and #ord# query , since they seem useless , and make the " cur " - > " cursor " change i suggest :
__label__anger	that 's clever , but the performance must be horrible . not that i be say there 's a good answer , just shudder at the o ( n^ ) of it .
__label__anger	i be intend on use the title attribute in the @page directive to customise each page title , but it simply do not appear to do anything . the site use master page - i do not know if that be a consideration . master page snippet : page snippet ( from ) : what be more , if i run the page through the , it complain about ‚Ä¶ end tag for " head " which be not finish .. whereas the the tag be present in the source code . i have already get a workaround in place , but it 's annoy the hell out of me , so i be determined to find a resolution !
__label__anger	nothing . regex be something i have to learn . javascript ‚Ä¶ i hate it !
__label__anger	i have do some easy . hover ( function ( ) statement in jquery . when i hover over a text i simply want a # div . fadein , and on non-hover fadeout . it work . but it 's just if i spam the text - trigger with hover and un-hoverring really quickly and then stop the animation begin to give a blink effect . it just kind of loop , really annoying !
__label__anger	i have a custom uitableviewcontroller class that be share among a few viewcontrollers of my app . i would like to do pre-emptive fetching before the user have hit the bottom of the page . however , i notice that if the user scroll up and then down again , my vc will trigger another fetching . so i come up with a flag isfetching which check to prevent double fetching . unfortunately i be run asynchronous code and i need a way to reset this flag after my fetch operation have complete . feedvc : delegate : i find it very painful to pass around a finish bloc in order to flip a boolean . do anyone have a good recommendation ?
__label__anger	just let ie0 flicker . i do not think it 's worth it to invest time in a die browser when your base functionality work well enough . if you be worried about flicker for accessibility reason , just sniff for ie0 and replace the animation with a generic show ( ) and hide ( ) instead . i recommend avoid complicated code for edge case that do not matter .
__label__anger	they sure do not @michaelszyndel . it 's extremely frustrating . i be use the late ver , too . i really would like to get it work properly .
__label__anger	yup , wcf be a world of config pain , stick to asmx
__label__anger	extremely lousy solution .
__label__anger	the question on how to check input for validity be answer numerous time ! you just check whether the stream be in a good state . if not , you will reset the stream and ignore the character . search for question where this answer . also , do not use exception for non-exceptional case and * always * throw something derive from ` std::exception ` : once you have try to locate where an exception come from which be not derive from ` std::exception ` in a program with a few #crd# line of code you will find it extremely helpful to look at what ` what ( ) ` return !
__label__anger	there 's always the poor man 's alternative of just load a bajillion individual frame as . gif / jpg / png and have javascript display them in sequence . it would be absolutely horrible for bandwidth and memory usage , and of course no audio , but it would ( somewhat ) simulate video be play . of course , on windows platform , you could use activex and / or embed medium player and play avi / wmv file as well , without ever touch flash .
__label__anger	im maintain a site where i need to ' click ' a link with javascript . the href be inline javascript , not a url so i can nt just navigate to that url instead . im expect this be bad practice ( the rest of the site be terrible ! ) but i need to make the link ' click ' with javascript . im use jquery . i know this question have be ask before but it seem normally people be try to follow the link , which i be not .
__label__anger	ironically year later , i be wonder why in the world i want to do this . i hate app that do this .
__label__anger	upvote i be think of program this myself . i really hate switch between my headphone and hdmi output .
__label__anger	holy thread abuse , batman !
__label__anger	i have to do this once in note for a plugin i be develop . what i ended up do be edit the note template in the designer , and then write some lotusscript behind it that call a . net class via a dll. so when you click the button , it trigger the event in the lotusscript , and then call the dll , and pass the item information to it . i should also note that it be a freakin ' bear to figure out because note documentation be terrible .
__label__anger	in python 's the follow minimal work example below draw correctly to the screen , and to the . in the result however , the edge line be still draw . how can i fix this ? png result pdf result while it seem trivial , it become extremely problematic when you stack plot , all you see be an ugly mess of black !
__label__anger	currently the msbuild log for team build be appalling as they be just plain text and be very difficult to read . also the #crd# create by my build be approx 0mb and take quite a while to download ( our tfs server be in our datacentre ) . do anyone know any way of be able to view these log easy , prefereably integrate with either tfs itself or tfs webaccess ?
__label__anger	part of the reason why this be " dog slow " be that you be build the proxy every time you connect to the service . you could avoid this pain by use wsdl0ruby to build the proxy permanently and then call the pre-generated proxy .
__label__anger	you could achieve all this with reflection but it would lead to a really horrible code . you would well access individual member of the view model :
__label__anger	no i get error say undefined , the swf code load the other page such as back button etc. it very frustrating tear my hair out !
__label__anger	this be extremely ugly c - style code , easy to get wrong . while the bug in your code have be fix by early bird , here be the c ++ way to do this :
__label__anger	and what do those " line upon line of error " say ? ( sheesh ! get information out of you be about as painful as pull out tooth ! ! )
__label__anger	the dreadful integer arithmetic attack again ! when you calculate (( ) / ) , since all the operand be integer , ruby use integer arithmetic rather than float point arithmetic . if you do it will also return , as it 's round down to the near integer , which be .
__label__anger	i have a function name call setvalue , use in many class . also , i have a global function by the same name . when i press c - ] , it go to arbitrary setvalue function . how do i directly jump to the global setvalue function ? it be really pain to use tnext every time to find if the function global .
__label__anger	i have a method that do a bunch of thing ; amongst them do a number of insert and update . it 's declare thusly ‚Ä¶ it work exactly as it be suppose to and i have no problem with it . there be situation however when i want to force the rollback in spite of there not be an exception ‚Ä¶ at the moment , i be force an exception when i encounter the right condition , but it 's ugly and i do not like it . can i actively call the rollback somehow ? the exception call it ‚Ä¶ i be think maybe i can too .
__label__anger	i be try to insert the follow array ( from a html form ) but i believe i be work with this array in a very awful way the array : actual code : ? > current output : what would be a decent way to do it ? edit : no need to show how to connect to a database , i just need to deal with the array datum .
__label__anger	dude i feel your pain , same issue here .
__label__anger	shortcut key often do not work the same way across all browser . and they be awful on opera . and most user wo not use them . the only thing i would bother with on most site be button for next and prev , and i would also make the alt tag say " next " or " previous " to assist browser with fast forward .
__label__anger	talk about feeling ‚Ä¶ i really hate the asp . net calendarextender ‚Ä¶
__label__anger	not for me , but i can suggest some possibility : it may cause problem while edit -- > this can be solve by use some comment -- > and then this will cause the code messier some code may crash and your code success will go away from you | . |--> no solution - unless you know more about the code ! code upgrade problem -- if external code have upgrade you may have problem to know which be that code -- > again use comment -- > and again messier so these be some that i can think about ! edit -- some cons:you can make it more convenient to edit -- > you can edit more than #crd# code at onceyou can edit some code that you wa not able to edit ( external resource before ) -- > modifying be more convenient . you can make it load fast -- > file with kb be fast than file with kb each . it be safe -- > you do not need to worry about external resource be delete ! ! these be my suggestion . try to think more about it !
__label__anger	wo not that be horribly distract ?
__label__anger	i be currently script blender right now but it 's excruciatingly slow for large model .
