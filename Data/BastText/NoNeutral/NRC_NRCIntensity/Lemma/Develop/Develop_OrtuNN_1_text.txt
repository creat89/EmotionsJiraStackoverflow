__label__love __label__joy	look excellent . really sweet . + where do the jar come from and what s its license ? + the rest api look good . very resty . there might be little nitpicks later but for it look great . how different be it from current rest . should the #crd# be the same ? if not , how to deprecate the old ? + the annotation look interesting . could their serialization be use in other context , the shell say ? or -- warning - > crazy - thought come -- somehow produce thrift idl ? + in hadoop / hbase , line length be < char ( your new class be miss apache license , class be miss comment describe what class be about , etc ) . + be there anything we could do refactoring htable say , so your modeling be easy ? look like lot of code in your cell and database controller . should our client be take on this model ? + can you add a note on how you have change how rest work , high - level ? that s all for now .

__label__love	thanks bob your patch be in trunk at r0
__label__love	commit . thanks hitesh !
__label__love	thanks for your comment , konstantin .
__label__love	sumeet , we do it purposely because if the proxy service be dynamically load then we need to build those service at the runtime and redeploy them which be a little bit risky on a production environment . also there be no mechanism to check whether a particular proxy definition be update in the registry or not because this configuration be use only at the startup . we can add this functionality to load the proxy service only at the startup time from the registry ( this do not mean they be dynamic ) , but i do not see any value there . if you could explain a bit about your exact requirement , i might be able to provide an alternative to this . thanks , ruwan

__label__love	patch apply . thanks a lot , especially for the test case . #hlink# ? rev = & view = rev #hlink# ? rev = & view = rev the result for and be definitely wrong . there 's a bug that need to be fix eventually . but since this be low - priority for me , i be go to leave it for now . i have add a comment to the new test case block - container0a that explain what be wrong . so i think i will close this issue . it 's primarily for the patch , after all , and the bug wo not be miss now that there be a check in our test suite . if anyone disagree , just reopen the issue or create a new #crd# .

__label__love	i just commit this . thanks nicholas !
__label__anger __label__sadness	sorry but this be just stupid .
__label__anger	pull it back in if you think different .
__label__anger	( how bad be this ?
__label__anger	precommit - hdfs - build be stuck .
__label__anger	@jira - i wish you do not suck so much .
__label__anger	but now that i think about it , it may crap out when come back to read even on a recover file .
__label__anger	umm .. call me crazy , but why be we make this public ?
__label__anger	that be bad .
__label__anger	damn it !
__label__anger	my bad !
__label__anger	this way lie metadata hell .
__label__anger	i abbreviate the heck out of my argument and think , but damn it that s what i think 🙂
__label__anger	igor be an idiot , and we * do * need gmake .
__label__anger	though i disagree with a signficant amount of statement you make , i do not think we would ever come to agreement anyway .
__label__anger	this be a very bad bug , introduce by me be an idiot .
__label__anger	i do not know we need to retain backwards config capability across .x to .x ☹️ that suck and it will make old code stick around long .
__label__anger	then , to make matter bad , since the mid- 's i have be offer pro bono advice to non-profit foundation whose member insult me regularly and assume i be an amateur .
__label__anger	that 's pretty unlikely .
__label__anger	crap , forget to verify that this be inconsistant with mri , it 's not .
__label__anger	stupid user error 🙂
__label__anger	the state stick at " allocate state " , it be a dup of .
__label__anger	my bad .
__label__anger	hadoop- : - if tarball be specify , hod no long validate for the pkgs directory in gridservice - hdfs or mapred section as these be not go to be use anyway .
__label__anger	bad .
__label__anger	i disagree … and i guess i be willing to go to bat for this .
__label__anger	that sucks , why be not the escape mechanism work ?
__label__anger	it may cause conflict , but if your intent be to break system security , you probably do not care .
__label__anger	ah , damn , i think it be fix 😕 guillaume ?
__label__joy	yay ! it should be really really easy ( not include the test ; i think it 's just delete character )
__label__joy	interesting that you decide not to detect the error base on find #crd# similarly - name operation .
__label__joy	this be awesome stefan - thanks a #crd# !
__label__joy	upvote , look good , i will commit this patch .
__label__joy	thanks for the help bj !
__label__joy	i have not see any bad behavior . i be use open ssh to test this . i use the escape character ; ~ ; and the period character ; . ; with open ssh to disconnect ; ' ~ . ' .
__label__joy	great ! i be glad you find it helpful .
__label__joy	look good to me markus . upvote
__label__joy	thanks for the review …
__label__joy	( @ddlatham : that s kinda funny that you write the link - to article -- it be a random google search )
__label__joy	thanks for the patch mubarak .
__label__joy	patch look good to me .
__label__joy	now why do i not think of that … 🙂 great idea , i will move the file to svn !
__label__joy	thank you , ivan !
__label__joy	fix thus : #hlink# ? rev = & view = rev
__label__joy	automatic location selection be very cool .
__label__joy	seem to work reliably now .
__label__joy	this be awesome - work in a #crd# - liner .
__label__joy	interesting , i just replace my src with the late in the trunk and do a compleatly clean build and the problem seem to have go away .
__label__joy	cool , that 's all good news too ! thanks guy . #crd# less on my radar .
__label__joy	cool stuff ! a good candidate to put on myfaces - common - utils , so the user can just add the resource handler on its webapp face - config .
__label__joy	great idea
