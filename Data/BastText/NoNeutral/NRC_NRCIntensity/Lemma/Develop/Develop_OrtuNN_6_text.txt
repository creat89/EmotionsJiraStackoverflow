__label__anger	ugh , well that suck .
__label__anger	i lose the whole morning cause hbase 's regionserver be die with no log , no nothing â€¦ how be i suppose to debug the issue if u do not even generate a core dump ?
__label__anger	hmm , that suck .
__label__anger	oh .. geez i be an idiot .
__label__anger	i do not think there be any sense in this , who care ?
__label__anger	i use to be the latter , but then i go to law school and get a degree in this shit .
__label__anger	damn it , sry lose the orientation .
__label__anger	damn time have fly â€¦

__label__anger	this be weird .
__label__anger	i be an idiot â€¦ there 's nothing wrong with the readme . txt .

__label__anger	aaarrggh , how stupid of mine to have a system . out , again !
__label__anger	bug flavio more ? seriously ; discuss with flavio and come up with a patch & test that be deterministic . another option would be to refactor to allow the code in question to be test as a true unit test ; rather than as a system test ( we need to work on that in general in zk ) . mockito ?
__label__anger	pull it back in if you think different .
__label__anger	weird .

__label__love	vishal kher to benjamin , camille am ( minute ago ) hi ben , i be go to open a jira after check with you guy . with your solution wo not we run in into the problem that camille point out by mark the snapshot for lastzxid - ? - peer fail after take the snapshot . the snapshot have apply lastzxid , which create a child znode . during recovery it will apply lastzxid , which will faill with nodeexists and we will increment the cversion of the parent ( after fix for zookeeper- ) . so creation of sequential znodes wo not be be really sequential . this be probably acceptable , but should be clearly document . if not , then from this bug , it look to me that patch zookeeper- be also not complete . we may need to conditionally update cversion . i think we need a clear document of how snapshot be suppose to work and what to assume while take snapshot and while recover from snapshot . it will be very helpful for to verify the correctness of implementation and for future bug fixes.i will open a jira for this bug shortly and post our discussion as well . thanks . - vishal

__label__sadness	and with a network that tolerate almost everything to get a mail somehow in the right place , it be only seldom notice ( or when it be , it be blame on microsoft .
__label__sadness	hi lars . sorry , i be not watch this before so i miss your work til you mention it on the hbase jira . i will try to take a look at this this week . feel free to grab me on irc if you have specific question .
__label__sadness	sorry , i miss bill 's comment . bq. we have see similar exception when load datum that contain text with the column delimiter in it , which produce short than expect tuples . could that be the case here ? i do not think that 's the case here . however , i have make many silly mistakes&misunderstandings in pig before . let me double check .
__label__sadness	sorry for the mistake .
__label__sadness	sorry , this should be yarn jira - file yarn- instead
__label__sadness	sorry , that should be filechannel inputchannel = input . getchannel ( ) ; filechannel outputchannel = output . getchannel ( ) ; in the try block .
__label__sadness	wrong patch , sorry .
__label__sadness	i have this issue , where my server and client be create a lot of loopback thread , that i believe must be related to this issue .
__label__sadness	sorry chris , i miss it , do !
