__label__anger __label__sadness	sorry but this is just stupid .
__label__surprise	google was also strangely quiet .
__label__surprise	any ideas ?
__label__anger	though i disagree with a signficant amount of statements you made , i do n't think we would ever come to agreement anyway .
__label__anger	i did n't know we needed to retain backwards config capability across .x to .x ☹️ that sucks and it 'll make old code stick around longer .
__label__anger	but now that i think about it , it may crap out when coming back to read even on a recovered file .
__label__anger	igor is an idiot , and we * do * need gmake .
__label__anger	this way lies metadata hell .
__label__anger	my bad .
__label__anger	precommit - hdfs - build is stuck .
__label__anger	i disagree … and i guess i 'm willing to go to bat for this .
__label__anger	this was a very bad bug , introduced by me being an idiot .
__label__anger	that is bad .
__label__anger	my bad !
__label__anger	( how bad is this ?
__label__anger	ah , damn , i thought it was fixed 😕 guillaume ?
__label__anger	umm ... call me crazy , but why are we making this public ?
__label__anger	the state stuck at " allocated state " , it is a dup of .
__label__anger	it may cause conflicts , but if your intent is to break system security , you probably do n't care .
__label__anger	stupid user error 🙂
__label__anger	hadoop- : - if tarball is specified , hod no longer validates for the pkgs directory in gridservice - hdfs or mapred sections as these are not going to be used anyway .
__label__anger	pull it back in if you think different .
__label__anger	that 's pretty unlikely .
__label__anger	@jira - i wish you did n't suck so much .
__label__anger	i abbreviated the heck out of my arguments and thinking , but damn it that s what i think 🙂
__label__anger	bad .
__label__anger	that sucks , why is n't the escape mechanism working ?
__label__anger	damn it !
__label__anger	crap , forgot to verify that this is inconsistant with mri , it 's not .
__label__anger	then , to make matters worse , since the mid- 's i 've been offering pro bono advice to non-profit foundations whose members insult me regularly and assume i 'm an amateur .
__label__fear	we 'll look at the issue for
__label__love __label__joy	upvote the patch looks good .
__label__love __label__joy	looks excellent . really sweet . + where does the jar come from and what s its license ? + the rest api looks good . very resty . there might be little nitpicks later but for it looks great . how different is it from current rest . should the two be the same ? if not , how to deprecate the old ? + the annotations look interesting . could their serializations be used in other contexts , the shell say ? or -- warning - > crazy - thought coming -- somehow producing thrift idl ? + in hadoop / hbase , line lengths are < chars ( your new classes are missing apache license , classes are missing comments describing what class is about , etc ) . + is there anything we could do refactoring htable say , so your modeling was easier ? looks like lots of code in your cell and database controllers . should our client be taking on this model ? + can you add a note on how you 've changed how rest works , high - level ? that s all for now .

__label__love	committed . thanks for the patch j - d
__label__love	i love this .
__label__love	sumeet , we did it purposely because if the proxy services are dynamically loaded then we need to build those services at the runtime and redeploy them which is a little bit risky on a production environment . also there is no mechanism to check whether a particular proxy definition is updated in the registry or not because this configuration is used only at the startup . we can add this functionality to load the proxy services only at the startup time from the registry ( this does n't mean they are dynamic ) , but i do n't see any value there . if you could explain a bit about your exact requirement , i might be able to provide an alternative to this . thanks , ruwan
__label__love	i just committed this . thanks nicholas !
__label__love	andrew , patch applied at revision r428265 , thanks a lot for this enhancement , please verify that the problem is fully fixed as you expected .
__label__sadness	sorry , on holiday last week and just catching up .
__label__sadness	forgot about these , sorry .
__label__sadness	snappycodec check for hadoop native lib is wrong .
__label__sadness	sorry for misleading attachment name .
__label__sadness	sorry , thiru , i hope you have n't already started working on this !
__label__sadness	sorry i forgot to mention : this is for the future branch !
__label__sadness	however , i figured it was better to get it in the public domain sooner and let the iterative process do it 's work .
__label__sadness	sorry , attached the file to the wrong issue .
__label__sadness	resolving again …
__label__sadness	sorry if this spam 's things , however it 's unlikely that i 'll work on these .
__label__sadness	, hours gone .
__label__sadness	while creating the derbytest i did notice that this problem is caused by the database pool because it tries to connect to the database in the background .
__label__sadness	sorry for the delay .
__label__sadness	sorry ; i 've reread the ioc code ; and you 're right . this is indeed not an issue . my apologies …
__label__sadness	please ignore attachment ( id = ) .
__label__sadness	tests no longer sleep
__label__sadness	sorry [ ~ svenkat ] , i just committed this .
__label__sadness	sorry about that .
__label__sadness	oops , it is my fault . please defer this patch , i 'll raise jira for other classes / interface as its dependance soon , sorry for inconvenience .
__label__sadness	sorry , fixed .
__label__sadness	a quickstart for the bug as eclipse / maven project . sorry for the delay .
__label__sadness	sorry about that .
__label__sadness	sorry again !
__label__sadness	sorry about that , fixed now .
__label__sadness	oh , sorry .
__label__sadness	this half - reuse is more confusing for new devs who see this code for the first time .
__label__sadness	my misunderstanding .
__label__sadness	sorry , i meant to have this patch in sooner but got quite busy , i expect to have it soon .
__label__sadness	hi , i just made some more ( long running ) tests , and found some problems in the patch i submitted . the mechanism is working , but it shrinks the caches too quickly , and it prints too much log output ( log . info instead of log . debug ) . i will fix those problems and submit a new patch . sorry . thomas
__label__sadness	sorry , no longer working on this
__label__sadness	problem - the bit to sign the source - release is being called when the source - release is n't being built because the source - release is only built at the " executionroot " .
__label__sadness	sorry .
__label__sadness	here are patches ... one for adjustexamplepaths . bat & . sh and the other a new file holding user libraries ... uima_lib & uima_as_lib not sure where this should go ...
__label__sadness	here is a stronger / generalized version of this patch . due to a lack to time on my part , this has not been compiled or tested , ( sorry ) . please test if you can david / joachim .
__label__sadness	sorry about this .
__label__joy	cool stuff ! a good candidate to put on myfaces - commons - utils , so the user can just add the resource handler on its webapp faces - config .
__label__joy	interesting that you decided not to detect the error based on finding two similarly - named operations .
__label__joy	yay ! it should be really really easy ( not including the test ; i think it 's just deleting characters )
__label__joy	this is awesome - works in a one - liner .
__label__joy	thanks for the patch mubarak .
__label__joy	fixed thus : http://svn.apache.org/viewvc ? rev = & view = rev
__label__joy	thanks for the reviews …
__label__joy	this is awesome stefan - thanks a million !
__label__joy	( @ddlatham : that s kinda funny that you wrote the linked - to article -- it was a random google search )
__label__joy	i have n't seen any bad behavior . i was using open ssh to test this . i used the escape character ; ~ ; and the period character ; . ; with open ssh to disconnect ; ' ~ . ' .
__label__joy	great ! i 'm glad you found it helpful .
__label__joy	thank you , ivan !
__label__joy	now why did i not think of that … 🙂 great idea , i 'll move the files to svn !
__label__joy	thanks for the help bj !
__label__joy	seems to work reliably now .
__label__joy	looks good to me markus . upvote
__label__joy	upvote , looks good , i will commit this patch .
__label__joy	patch looks good to me .
__label__joy	interesting , i just replaced my src with the latest in the trunk and did a compleatly clean build and the problem seems to have gone away .
__label__joy	automatic location selection is very cool .
__label__joy	great idea
__label__joy	cool , that 's all good news too ! thanks guys . one less on my radar .
