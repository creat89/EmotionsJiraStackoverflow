__label__joy	look good . bq. i do not add version to stopfilter nor stopanalyzer ; i think it 's good to up-front require the " enablepositionincrements " to their ctors . i would add it to stopanalyzer , stopfilter be not so important ( because low - level ) . but that 's my opinion .
__label__sadness	oh , sign shift !
__label__love	thanks to hazem saleh for provide us this enhancement fix at revision
__label__love	thanks andrew , commit in rev.
__label__love	apply , thanks .
__label__love	please let me know if you need something else .
__label__anger	this be a very bad bug , introduce by me be an idiot .
__label__love	commit to trunk , branch- and branch- - beta . thanks jian .
__label__joy	thanks ram , that seem like a definite improvement .
__label__surprise	i do have some interest in work on this ; but it 's not currently on my radar . implement solr- would illustrate the issue that need fix .. although if this be tackle #ord# ; write solr- would be much easy .
__label__joy	thanks , jeff !
__label__joy	great ! awesome ! thanks , dim
__label__love	i just commit this to both trunk and mr- . thanks jeffrey !
__label__joy	pretty sure this be fix by the time we release jruby .
__label__joy	take me a few #ord# to get it , but then i realize how awesome it be .
__label__anger	upvote for this : my bad .
__label__love	thanks , oliver !
__label__love	hi dan ! !
__label__joy	cool , look good .
__label__love	[ ~ bikassaha ] thanks for the head - up bikas ! this jira be not concerned with the tez integration for pig and be simply the abstraction in pig to allow for alternate executionengines in pig . but will certainly change this on the tez integration side of stuff . thanks a lot [ ~ cheolsoo ] for continue this ! i think everything look good from my end . i can certainly see why we may want to keep this on a different branch until everything be finalize . certain thing may still need more work . for example , outputstats be not complete abstract out , as it still have reference to postore which be a mr implementation construct . scriptstate / ppnl / jobstats may still need more abstraction ( especially ppnl ) and reworking to incorporate a new executionengine abstraction . i think what we have do here be the minimum foundation for an abstraction though , and it would be appropriate to put into trunk , but these be not my decision to make . with regard to public method that be change , i do not think most of them be a big deal , besides as cheolsoo say , the pigserver throw pigexception . i never think ioexception be a good exception to throw , but i think revert pigserver back to ioexception as it be userfacing code be not a big deal . the rest of the method signature change should not be worrisome because most of them be internal to the project . however , the change from jobstats to mrjobstats , while necessary ( as each executionengine would have it 's own type of jobstats it would present to the end user ) , could be problematic because it be userfacing code and would probably break people who be previously use jobstats . that i think be the most important thing to keep in mind . the task of make the ppnl and jobstats clearly tie to the executionengine should be think through also .
__label__anger	so , it be stick somewhere .
__label__love __label__joy	thanks a lot for fix those issue , alejandro . i re-ran all the test i run last night and everything work great . additionally , i try out #hlink# , which seem to work flawlessly . upvote , patch look good to me .

__label__joy	look good .
__label__love	thanks [ ~ ajisakaa ] . upvote pending jenkins .

__label__love	thanks areek , new patch look great ; i will commit shortly .
__label__love	that fix my testcase . thank you !
__label__anger	an output connector should also have a say in what url it will accept .
__label__joy	this be awesome - work in a #crd# - liner .
__label__anger	i really mean to remove this functionality : what be the use for it anyway ? it do not hurt today ( except for a few byte eat ) but it may be confusing . so ; if there be no clear use and requirement for it ; i suggest to just remove it .
__label__anger	this suck badly .
__label__joy	this look safe also
__label__surprise	it 's a feature which seem to be enable by default .
__label__joy	seem to work reliably now .

__label__love	thanks for review and test case , knut .
__label__love __label__joy	thanks ! üôÇ
__label__love	patch apply . thanks a lot , especially for the test case . #hlink# ? rev = & view = rev #hlink# ? rev = & view = rev the result for and be definitely wrong . there 's a bug that need to be fix eventually . but since this be low - priority for me , i be go to leave it for now . i have add a comment to the new test case block - container0a that explain what be wrong . so i think i will close this issue . it 's primarily for the patch , after all , and the bug wo not be miss now that there be a check in our test suite . if anyone disagree , just reopen the issue or create a new #crd# .
__label__sadness	damn .
__label__anger	i do not know we need to retain backwards config capability across .x to .x ‚òπÔ∏è that suck and it will make old code stick around long .
__label__love	this work great for me ; but it have demonstrate another issue when some tapestry 's script file try to use the clientid in order to create javascript identifier for variable . i will open a new issue describe this .

__label__love	thanks ivan . i will do the change by just return if it match as you suggest . i will investigate it later . bq . auditor will be a top level daemon , so it should own its create it 's own ledgermanagers and zookeeper client . the only thing pass in to be should be the configuration . anyway we be plan to have initialization class which do start auditor and rw thread . would you agree to create ledgermanagers there and pass it to the auditor and rw daemon ? in that case , shall i keep the ctor as it be . ( by take manager ) { code } public auditor ( string bookieidentifier , abstractconfiguration conf , zookeeper zkc , ledgermanager ledgermanager , ledgerunderreplicationmanager ledgerunderreplicationmanager ) { { code }
__label__love __label__joy	upvote patch change look trivial . thanks !

__label__love	commit to trunk . thanks , thejas !
__label__love	take it over thanks , mayank
__label__fear	out of curiosity ; could we save a follow notification as our lastmessage then ; even if we do not send it ? that would give you the ' current ' state more accurately than a stale look notification and it seem like it could solve this particular problem . we could ; but that would not give an accurate state as well . a peer might be in the look state ( next fle round ) while the lastmessage get send . there will be race condition . in my opinion ; a good way of do this be to send the current state instead of lastmessage . in which case ; i agree with flavio that send the final notification wo not be necessary . this will also reduce the number of notification exchange .
__label__love	hi chris , thanks for your detailed response . thanks ,
__label__love __label__joy	no , this be on ( sorry , i should have mention that before ) . that 's great to know , thanks !
__label__love	thanks [ ~ cnauroth ] & [ ~ tomwhite ] for the review !

__label__love __label__joy	nice ! thanks for add nice debug logging , too üôÇ
__label__love	thanks for the clarification . i will reintroduce separate datum structure for lead / follow notification .
__label__love	to test this ; i use an aggregate ae with a cas multiplier that declare getcasinstancesrequired ( ) = . if this ae be instantiate and run in a loop with early code it eat up roughly 0mb per iteration . no such leak with the late code . thanks !
__label__love __label__joy	look good ; the other service have the type hint too ; so this be indeed an erroneous situation . apply & commit ; thanks !
__label__love __label__joy	thanks for the new patch , kristian ! the change look good to me . upvote to commit . a tiny nit in statementpoolingtest ; the code below could be express with an assertequals now that there 's only #crd# condition : if ( ! simplename . equal ( expectedname )) { - if ( ! simplename . equal ( expectedname + " " )) { - fail ( " expect class name " + expectedname + " or " + - expectedname + " , get " + simplename ) ; - } + fail ( " expect class name " + expectedname + " , get " + + simplename ) ; }
__label__joy	upvote look good to me .
__label__sadness	sorry to be late get back to this . be a very busy week -- just get some time this afternoon and evening . the attach configurablesimplehttpserver . patch provide facility to fully configure a simplehttpserver for production use . a new class httpfactory be introduce that be a ) configurable with the most commonly set parameter , like request core thread pool size , request socket timeout , origin server header , etc. , and b ) specializable to supply factory method to override all the default class instantiate by simplehttpserver . this be important to achieve thing like a bound request queue . the parameter be also all settable in #hlink# as part of the http transportin config . all axis0 test pass , plus i have update my application with a custom specialization of httpfactory that be heavily configure and it also work properly . i would like to look this over again tomorrow , and test the #hlink# feature ( not test yet ) , but want to post this #ord# version now to get comment on the approach . deepal , dim suggest you might be the right person to look this over ? also , oleg , i would appreciate any thought you have . the patch be against my local repository , but i expect it will apply against the svn head since simplehttpserver patch apply against ( with different offset for the hunk in #crd# file ) . if there be any issue , i will make sure it apply cleanly against svn head tomorrow . thanks , chuck
__label__love	commit . thanks hitesh !
__label__anger	hell , unaryfunction might even be fast than all of these call in a row .

__label__sadness	hi lars . sorry , i be not watch this before so i miss your work til you mention it on the hbase jira . i will try to take a look at this this week . feel free to grab me on irc if you have specific question .
__label__joy	thanks guy for save mankind !
__label__joy	bertrand - nice work . this be a great idea and the patch look good overall . couple of point : - do not forget the apache header on the new error class - maybe do the grammar correction on the counter error message separately ? just so we keep the commits to a single issue each . - i be not sure we need to retain the delegating " formatvaluelist " method in testdriver . something to discuss ‚Ä¶ as for use guava to do the string join - i know mrunit use to have it as a dependency but this be remove in mrunit- . probably not worth bring it back for such a simple method .
__label__love	commit to trunk . thanks edward .
__label__joy	many thanks for your help .
__label__love	commit to trunk . thanks for review , stack and ryan .
__label__anger	i sure as hell do not want to start attach model for the sake of detach them directly afterwards .
__label__anger	it seem some of the wrapper in ink_hrtime.h ( ) might no longer be use either , e.g. ink_gettimeofday ( ) be never use , so let s get rid of that shit .
__label__anger	i lose the whole morning cause hbase 's regionserver be die with no log , no nothing ‚Ä¶ how be i suppose to debug the issue if u do not even generate a core dump ?
__label__love	hi rich ! thanks for take the time to move forward on this . i do not have any junit problem at all with maven0 when i instal it . but clearly we be in a world of hard - to - replicate behavior here . üôÇ what be the exact problem you be see ?

__label__joy	automatic location selection be very cool .
__label__sadness	oops , sorry folk . wrong project .
__label__anger	damn time have fly ‚Ä¶
__label__sadness	this half - reuse be more confusing for new devs who see this code for the #ord# time .

__label__sadness	* sorry *
__label__love	thanks tucu ! you be right . i have not think of that . i be on the fence because we be serialize a process which should happen fast ( so parallelizing be good ) . like you already mention bq. * add a method in the filesystem to disable its shutdown hook . mrappmaster would disable it and call closeall ( ) explicitly ( it already do ) . this be already present ( by set conf . setboolean ( " #hlink# " , false ) ) so i be not sure what problem this jira be fix . or be we plan for the future ? i be fine with the latter answer be yes . i be just curious . the patch look good for what it intend to do , although the late #crd# do not include the fix you make in response to nicholas ' comment .

__label__sadness	but it be not the only issue : we also want to manage priority between the task , but we need to read them to get enough information to make the right priority .

__label__love	vishal kher to benjamin , camille am ( minute ago ) hi ben , i be go to open a jira after check with you guy . with your solution wo not we run in into the problem that camille point out by mark the snapshot for lastzxid - ? - peer fail after take the snapshot . the snapshot have apply lastzxid , which create a child znode . during recovery it will apply lastzxid , which will faill with nodeexists and we will increment the cversion of the parent ( after fix for zookeeper- ) . so creation of sequential znodes wo not be be really sequential . this be probably acceptable , but should be clearly document . if not , then from this bug , it look to me that patch zookeeper- be also not complete . we may need to conditionally update cversion . i think we need a clear document of how snapshot be suppose to work and what to assume while take snapshot and while recover from snapshot . it will be very helpful for to verify the correctness of implementation and for future bug fixes.i will open a jira for this bug shortly and post our discussion as well . thanks . - vishal
__label__sadness	sorry for the wild goose chase !
__label__sadness	my error .
__label__surprise	what be convenient for the user to download #crd# archive to run the project ( or install maven ) ?

__label__anger	bug flavio more ? seriously ; discuss with flavio and come up with a patch & test that be deterministic . another option would be to refactor to allow the code in question to be test as a true unit test ; rather than as a system test ( we need to work on that in general in zk ) . mockito ?

__label__anger	btw : this be #crd# reason why i hate this autoboxing shit since java . i would love to have a way to prevent it in code ( forbid check should detect this somehow ) .

__label__anger	you be mix runtime . you must link _ all _ executables with the same run - time library . for release ; it 's multithreaded dll ; for debug ; it 's debug multithreaded dll. otherwise ; bad thing will happen when memory allocate from #crd# heap be free in another . i rebuild your code with the appropriate setting ; and everything work fine . see the project setting dialog box ; c / c ++ tab ; and the ' code generation ' category .
__label__love	i just commit this . thanks , sanjay !
__label__joy	upvote patch look good .
__label__anger	stupid user error üôÇ
__label__love	yes , it work ok now , thanks .
__label__love	hi ivan , { quote } + long numberofentriestoreplicate = lastentryid - firstentryid ; should be ( lastentryid - firstentryid ) + { quote } you be right , both side entry have to be consider . thank a lot for notice it . { quote } in general , i think this splitting should be in ledgerfragmentreplicator , rather than bookkeeperadmin . this way you could avoid the need to expose the update of ledger metadata . it will make control flow a little more complex as you will have to initiate replication on the next subfragment from the callback of the current , but i think it would encapsulate thing a bit good . { quote } yes , in general , all the split logic should be in lfr. i might push that code to bkadmin because , i do not want to disturb admin key flow much , which will go through lfr. now anyway , i move that logic , still not disturbing bkadmin key flow in anyway . attach a patch , which address the comment . also to give more confidence on split fragment scenario , i have add multiple boundary case for fragmentsplit . thanks a lot , ivan for your nice review !
__label__sadness	sorry , should have comment on this much soon .
__label__joy	look quite perfect after solve pdfbox- .

__label__sadness	hi andreas , sorry for my late reply . i have not look in to the difference between use the responsebuilder#getfilters and use filter 's in a normal query . be there any functional difference between the #crd# way other than that #crd# of them utilize solr 's filtercache and the other do not ?

__label__joy	awesome !
__label__love	thanks bryan for convert these test . in use the derby- conversion tool , can you double check that it do not omit the fail assert method after a method call in a try - catch block when the statement be expect to fail . e.g. instead of try { #hlink# ( command ) ; } catch ( sqlexception e ) { assertsqlstate ( " " , e ) ; } it should be : try { #hlink# ( command ) ; fail ( " command expect to fail " + command ) ; } catch ( sqlexception e ) { assertsqlstate ( " " , e ) ; }

__label__love	thanks a ton for your review , todd . here 's an update patch which address all of your comment except the follow . bq. in editlogfileinputstream , why do we need to pass isinprogress as a boolean ? if it 's in-progress , that mean we do not know the lasttxid , so it would be invalid_txid , right ? so we can implement isinprogress ( ) by just compare lasttxid . because in the case of pre-transactional elfis , we pass in invalid_txid , even though the log be not yet in progress . i be still work on produce an update patch which also add testing for the pending dn message queue .

__label__love __label__joy	look excellent . really sweet . + where do the jar come from and what s its license ? + the rest api look good . very resty . there might be little nitpicks later but for it look great . how different be it from current rest . should the #crd# be the same ? if not , how to deprecate the old ? + the annotation look interesting . could their serialization be use in other context , the shell say ? or -- warning - > crazy - thought come -- somehow produce thrift idl ? + in hadoop / hbase , line length be < char ( your new class be miss apache license , class be miss comment describe what class be about , etc ) . + be there anything we could do refactoring htable say , so your modeling be easy ? look like lot of code in your cell and database controller . should our client be take on this model ? + can you add a note on how you have change how rest work , high - level ? that s all for now .
__label__anger	i suspect it have nothing to do with the file system connector or infinispan connector , and be simply a ( stupid ) mistake in the federated join processor .

__label__joy	that 's a good point ; we should make sure that it do not decrease performance for #crd# of the database type , even if it increase it for oracle ( in which case , make it configurable in #hlink# would be a good idea too ) .
__label__love	commit . thanks yongqiang
__label__sadness	i be not able to reproduce the problem with the attachment . i see appropriate error message ; line number ; etc. however ; line number information be miss for the testcase idkeyerr0 ; so i have commit a patch which remedy this .
__label__joy	upvote look good . as for the naming : [ jira ] .patch stand for trunk patch , imo . any branch designation can be add as qualifier . thanks
__label__love	commit to trunk . thanks , prasanth !
__label__sadness	hello , sure you be right here , i do not make myself clear enough im sorry . as you ( and rfc0 ) say , when we be send the file we should transform to nvt - ascii but not when we be receive the file . in this #ord# case , i think that the expect behaviour be that the text message be write to a file with the default line separator for the platform . the sender convert the datum from an internal character representation to the standard - bit nvt - ascii representation ( see the telnet specification ) . the receiver will convert the datum from the standard form to his own internal form . actually , accord to the spec before a retr ascii operation be transform we should be convert the charset to ascii , for our machine could be use ebcdic to store file and client be suppose to expect that file be encode in nvt - ascii . so i do not know .. any way , this have little priority for me ( until someone use a non-ascii - compatible encoding complain ) so we could leave this for the future . any way i do not like ascii mode for it break the ' rest ' command . my implementation only support binary mode .
__label__joy	nothing wrong , everything be cool .
__label__love	please contact me if you need any clarification .
__label__sadness	sorry , i have accidentally delete the -- disable - eventfd from my compilation script .
__label__love	thanks a lot for your help !

__label__love	jacopo , thank you for your work ! i will test it today and let you know what i find .
__label__love	hi aki , i strongly suggest you write a persistence system test both for client and server side , which can expose the problem you mention and also verify your fix work . actually we already have serverpersistencetest and clientpersistencetest in systests / ws - spec , i think you can add yours in those #crd# class . btw , your suggestion seem ok for me . thanks freeman

__label__joy	cool , no worry .
__label__sadness	sorry for the noise .
__label__love	ok thanks ! close the issue then .
__label__love	look at datastax 's debian package , the change do not make its way in. dig deep , it 's only on the cassandra- branch . can someone merge / cherry - pick it to cassandra- and trunk . thanks , blair
__label__sadness	thanks to mathias werlitz - sorry for the delay .
__label__anger	stupid maven
__label__love __label__joy	thanks randy ! commit ; - r
__label__anger	the sample you give be different .
__label__sadness	i be very busy for the moment so i do not know when i ' d be able to the change myself , so if you can , your contribution would be #crd# more time really appreciate .
__label__sadness	> alexander shorin not quite , i propose that the url remain the same . merely the source code get move around . on release - packaging time , #hlink# be pull in from the other repo . i mean in long term vision ( e.g. for couchdb + ) . it 's oblivious that for .x it will also available by old url and new #crd# ( if any ) . but ok . > jquery . js should stay the way it be as long as we ship futon . so when we replace futon with fauxton ( this will happen anyway ) we also stop ship with #hlink# and his deps , correct ? i want to clarify this moment since it be the main of this issue and to be sure that we all think about the same . sorry for such persistent question ! thanks ( :
__label__anger	and boy , hell break loose üòâ so ‚Ä¶ the big issue i be face be indeed with random sharing across thread .
__label__anger	a feature with wrong functionality be as bad as , if not bad than , a bad performance .
__label__love	hi . the code above be a copy of the charsetutil class just run within a junit test case . there be no exception other than #hlink# . be you able to reproduce the error ? thanks richard
__label__anger	ah - my bad .
__label__sadness	i be in too much of a hurry , sorry hold on a sec .
__label__sadness	not sure i want the transient inability to clean up some local log or other trivial task to kill a whole pig job ?
__label__anger	my bad !
__label__love	patch apply . thanks florian .
__label__love	thanks , jing !
__label__sadness	and with a network that tolerate almost everything to get a mail somehow in the right place , it be only seldom notice ( or when it be , it be blame on microsoft .
__label__anger	heh , that 's #crd# hell of a bug , byte exactly , eh ?
__label__joy	thanks ashutosh and gunther for your help !
__label__anger	i think the correct resolution be to ensure that the prefix stack mechanism get reset each time the xmlreader be use .
__label__sadness	sorry for the noise .
__label__anger	this be very bad document .
__label__love	. my feeling be that " if ( file . lastmodified ( ) < now + access_time_resolution ) " be not necessary , since the lastmodified value will already be truncate to the system resolution , but i do not think it be harmful . . i choose to throw exception only if file . canwrite , because i be try to minimise the impact of the change . it 's not clear to me whether setlastmodified might work when ! file . canwrite . however , it certainly must work ( because of gc ) if file . canwrite . i would consider move the canwrite test outside of the setlastmodified call , similar to getrecordifstored , it just be not necessary to fix the immediate problem . . well , not swallow exactly , but catch and convert to failure return code ( downvote ) e.g. see blobindatastore . getsize . in any case , the javadoc for #hlink# document downvote as a possible " failure " return code , so it have to be test . i think if #hlink# throw an exception , that be already correctly handle . thanks for the quick response .
__label__love	thank you very much for your effort david .
__label__sadness	sorry , here 's the test that reproduce the issue .
__label__joy	look good to me markus . upvote
__label__anger	must be : size > = !
__label__love	#ord# sorry for the delay . it look like this patch slip through . i try to apply it , but there be a bunch of conflict ( some of them be related to recent docstring format change and other seem to be related to other change ) . can you please re-generate the patch against the late trunk ? thanks !
__label__joy	üòÉ
__label__love	thanks for provide this update . will try to take a look at this sometime this week .
__label__love	ahhh sweet , i be guess you have an ide that do this ? if the test pass commit , this kinda crap go out of date too fast !
__label__sadness	sorry for the late review . have a few minor question / comment . . what happen if have instance of consumer with the same clientid in the same jvm ? do #crd# of them fail because it fail to register metrics ? ditto for producer . . consumertopicstats : what if a topic be name alltopics ? we use to handle this by add a - in topic specific stat . . zookeeperconsumerconnector : do we need to validate groupid ? . clientid : do the clientid length need to be different from topic length ? . abstractfetcherthread : when build a fetch request , do we need to pass in brokerinfo as part of the client id ? brokerinfo contain the source broker info and the fetch request be always make to the source broker .
__label__sadness	sorry .
__label__love	just commit this to trunk and branch . thanks rakesh !
__label__love	i see you rebased the patch , thanks a lot .
__label__love	commit to trunk . thanks jarcec !
__label__love	the code have be check in. thanks to gordon for that .
__label__sadness	sorry , this bug be * not * fix .
__label__love	commit to trunk . thanks , sushanth !
__label__sadness	sorry , i be try to get to the wiki but it 's be a busy week .
__label__sadness	sorry , miss this .
__label__sadness	problem - the bit to sign the source - release be be call when the source - release be not be build because the source - release be only build at the " executionroot " .
__label__joy	cool feature ! performance : - it look like script be read from the resource loader and parse again ( eval ) for every update request .
__label__joy	thanks to both of you , and to deepesh for the initiative .
__label__love	thanks , rick !
__label__love	the v0 change look good . thanks
__label__sadness	but app developer should always explicitly set it base on their application my guess be that a large enough group of people take the default that it matter .
__label__joy	cool stuff ! a good candidate to put on myfaces - common - utils , so the user can just add the resource handler on its webapp face - config .
__label__sadness	i will try to do more research on it .
__label__joy	ok cool , this be just a matter of add string to the various [ notfound ( ) | #hlink# return in file . cpp there be a number of error case in the [ browse | #hlink# and [ read | #hlink# endpoint , i would imagine #crd# could change the javascript to generate bad request which should be sufficient to test this üôÇ
__label__joy	sound like a good idea .
__label__sadness	i have no idea about fetch binary datum , sorry . be it flash ? look like my patch address all #crd# point , fail only for handle raw byte .

__label__love	sumeet , we do it purposely because if the proxy service be dynamically load then we need to build those service at the runtime and redeploy them which be a little bit risky on a production environment . also there be no mechanism to check whether a particular proxy definition be update in the registry or not because this configuration be use only at the startup . we can add this functionality to load the proxy service only at the startup time from the registry ( this do not mean they be dynamic ) , but i do not see any value there . if you could explain a bit about your exact requirement , i might be able to provide an alternative to this . thanks , ruwan

__label__sadness	hi lars , sorry about the delay in respond . good point about the treemap always return result in a deterministic ordering . the patch itself i think be still beneficial because it remove a little bit of redundancy in the exist equality code . imo , the fix make it easy to understand as well . in addition , the test be beneficial since we be miss coverage there . i think it would be good if the fix be in soon , but it 's probably not an issue if we move it to .

__label__anger	i be an idiot .
__label__sadness	wrong patch , sorry .
__label__sadness	sorry , i be not able to create #crd# diff - file , so i add for every build . xml an own diff .
__label__love __label__joy	> tilman hausherr hello , finally it work ! i just download the revision , and bulded it with ant . and add the new * . jar to my project 's build path . it print very well . thank you very much .
__label__love	i will look into the namespace handler . thanks . yes , i should have add the different event handle support to the todo above . i need to think more about this and look into the camel code a bit more . use just the endpoint api , i could not create route on the fly , hence the polling consumer approach . i will keep hack away at in in my toolbox when customer need dictate . be i miss something in your approach , how would i do this then in the xml dsl use your approach ? i think virtual routing be a known limitation of camel when you start to deploy large scale system . out of curiosity have you see camel ever be deploy with 's of route ( and / or route file ) ? i think this would have fd and thread overkill problem . everything repeat itself üôÇ
__label__love	thanks for the review , guy !
__label__love	commit to trunk . thank you lorand !
__label__anger	i be confused .
__label__joy	i be still not in love with the sarcasm or excessive negativity . i will just point a few thing out . / i do not veto anything , and this have nothing to do with c ++ . i think it be a bad idea for us to generate code in a way that cause semantics to silently change when a new optional field be add . this in dangerous in the long term . / i have no problem revert this change . / restore the old constructor and mark in deprecate be probably a good idea .
__label__love	hi antonio , i can take this #crd# , if nobody be work on it . would be a nice #crd# to get my foot wet ‚Ä¶ üôÇ thx , sam

__label__love __label__joy	patch look great ! thanks artem . no more mixing in of fuzzy - ness into analyzingsuggester . it look like we be do the utf0 conversion + det twice per lookup , once in convertautomaton and once in getfullprefixpaths . but , i think this be inevitable : the #ord# conversion be on the " straight " automaton , for exactfirst match , and the #ord# #crd# be on the lev automaton , for non-exactfirst . really we should only do the #ord# convertautomaton if exactfirst be true .. but this be an optimization so we do not need to fix it now .
