__label__joy __label__sadness	yes ... all this works ... but if the user presses their refresh button on their browser it will add another record .
__label__fear	i must investigate further , but i fear it 's not : big precompiled pieces of middleware ahead !
__label__fear	it sounds very scary to me to use a floating point number for a key in a ` map ` .
__label__fear	nope … does n't fix it i 'm afraid !
__label__fear	i am about to alter the several tables in a massive system which i probably only understand around % . i want to add three columns . one of these is just a rename of an existing column . part of me wants to :- rename the column but worried about the impact on unknown parts of the system that use the old name . append the three columns to the table therefore making the old column redundant ( over time ) .
__label__fear	i have a django application built in our shop and currently we are moving to production that will run a apache web server . the application will run on multiple webservers due to load issues . now , i 'm really worried since it 's running multiple webservers . issue - the application generates unique ids for session management and maintains it locally . now , if a user goes to webservers - a and creates a unique id and then in the next request goes to webservers - b he will be invalidated because the unique id created for him will be local to webservers - a. how can i fix this issue ?
__label__fear	my application links against libsamplerate.a . i am doing this to make distributing the final binary easier . i am worried that perhaps the code inside the . a file depends on some other libraries i also will need to distribute . but if it does n't i am worried i am bloating up my application too much by including multiple copies of eg . libc . what exactly will be inside libsamplerate.a ? just libsamperate 's bytecode ? or more ?

__label__fear	is this valid ? what i 'm really worried about is can you specify type and also use def at the same time ?

__label__surprise	i have done some research for " the bast way to insert huge data into db with c # " then a lot of people just suggested me using sqlbulkcopy . after i tried it out and it really amazed me . undoubtedly , sqlbulkcopy is very very fast . it seems that sqlbulkcopy is a perfect way to insert data ( especially huge data ) . but why do nt we use it at all times . is there any drawback of using sqlbulkcopy ?
__label__surprise	i did n't know that . i always thought it was and .
__label__surprise	why does the test return false ?

__label__love	i have been trying to create a slider based on nivo slider that looks and functions similar to the carousel found at i have viewed questions by and by , however i have been going round in circles for most of the weekend . now back at square one and starting from the basics . thus far i have managed to get the navigation working such that mouseenter on a particular nav item triggers nivo - controlnav to display the correct slide and pauses the slider : i also created a subsequent mouseleave function for the nav items ( , , etc. ) i 'm now stuck at the part where non-mouse events come in. when the slider loads it should update the nav css to highlight the current nav item selected . here is what i 've got ( not a lot i know , but i 'm trying ) . then the simple html nav menu : any help / ideas / musings would be hugely appreciated !

__label__love	i 'd say spike should be part of the iteration plan . not just in time . they should be accounted for the story they belong to . even reading of parts of the manual should be estimated . and now for the hard part : do n't be afraid to give high estimates . realistic is always better than too low . 😉
__label__love	i 'd be interested to hear how this works out . you are very brave 🙂
__label__love	excellent ! thank you so much for the thorough explanation , and for providing the demo . so ` eval ( ) ` allows you to access the value stored in each variable . this is handy if you want the name of your variable to itself be stored in a variable . handy ! you did an excellent job explaining . gold star for you . 🙂

__label__love	two excellent answers , thank you ! i chose andrew 's primarily because i learned a bit more about knockout from it , but both are good options . i 'd use rp 's method to get something to use in a more generic " anything can be chosen " scenario , but i think making it a single object is probably a better fit for my uses .
__label__love	excellent handle 🙂

__label__love	david flanagan 's excellent book on javascript has an example that shows how to perform xpath queries in ie . on page of fifth edition , you can see the following code snippet taken from example - : i found out the hard way that this code is absolutely necessary . it appears ( although i ca nt understand why ) that on ie xmlhttprequest seems to to randomly return a reference to either the document corresponding to the received xml or the documentelement . what s happening here ?

__label__love	@kevin oh , excellent ! i see now that it 's a fairly obvious answer , but that tool is perfect . thanks !
__label__love	upvote that looks like an excellent resource !
__label__love	upvote for this question - i have the same issue .
__label__love	excellent , thanks !
__label__love	why are you so afraid of an asynchronous solution ? would n't this by definition need to be on a separate thread ? remember this is a tcp connection , so you do essentially have to wait for a response before you can send your request .

__label__anger	i hate writing migrations , but it 's important for the schemas to stay in sync. what i 'd much rather do is update my and have rails notice , then run something which generates the appropriate migration based on the difference between the old version and the current version . is there a way i can do that ?

__label__anger	this is a problem with windows firewall that is very annoying from its introduction . and persist trough several versions of windows . i have two questions : is it possible to be disabled or at least require confirmation in xp / server ? does uac handles this in vista / server ? if it does not - is there any way to disable it ?
__label__anger	i built an xml - rpc server in python using simplexmlrpcserver , according to the example in the python documentation . i 'm calling it from a python client on the same machine . the body of the server function executes very fast on its own . but i find that xmlrpc client performance is excruciatingly slow , taking one second per call . ( using xmlrpclib . ) a speed - up technique i found on the web ( ) did n't help . my connect uri is : i 'm running python x64 on windows , but it works the same for - bit python .
__label__anger	lately , bringing the help window from visual studio is taking a long time . even updating the help system takes an awful long time . is there something broken with my installation ?
__label__anger	oh , this was was a pain ! i probably lost hours on this . here is the solution : cmake uses short ' c ' applications to test / try things . if the cmakelists . txt states that c ++ is used for the project , without also listing c , then some of those shorts tests incorrectly fail , and cmake then thinks those things are n't found . the solution was to change the first line of cmakelists from this : ... to include c as a language : then delete , recreate it , and everything then works :
__label__anger	so , the following hack seems to work , but it 's really incredibly ugly imo , as it relies on you controlling the line - height and using absolute positioning . worse , it requires you to know how many lines there are in your text , which depends on the width of the div and the font - size , and probably requires js to compute . anyway , after all the above disclaimers , here 's the hack : use two divs with the same text , one on top of the other . one justified , one centered . then clip the justified one . html css fiddle . of course , the above code is hard - coded for the specific width . again , you 'll probably need js in order to compute the number of lines in the div. i 'm pretty sure that until this gets implemented in webkit you probably wo n't find an elegant solution for your problem .
__label__anger	vineet , what you are trying to do is a terrible idea ! if you ever find yourself having to engineer something as fundamental as that , take a step back and work out what else does it ! i do n't really believe in the whole spoon fed so thing , but what mtwebster says is on the right track !
__label__anger	how do i stop a browser refresh from happening when a flash object has focus inside a pop up window ? yes , i abhor pop up windows too . yet we have a flash questionnaire that is being wrecked from users who use refresh . i also already have js in place that effectively blocks refresh , until the flash gets focus and the user presses refresh . i have access to the flash through our flash developer , but he is uncertain of how to do this . the closest we could come up with was to use the fscommand trapallkeys , yet it does not appear to be working .
__label__anger	that 's a really terrible way to read in all your files . try this : this will return a list of data frames , each of which is the contents of the corresponding file . or , if there are other csv files that you do n't want to read in , you can restrict the specification : and to combine everything into one big data frame :

__label__anger	i get the following when i build locally i get this error when building locally or on the team foundation server . not exactly sure how to solve it , have the iis app pool and web site running as the tfs user so it does n't have any problem viewing the website but the error is really irritating as its always telling me my build is broken .

__label__anger	i know i can configure command line arguments in the run configuration but i want to run a java file multiple times with different command line arguments . it 's a pain to change the run configuration every time . is there a way i can make eclipse prompt me for command line arguments every time i run the program ?

__label__anger	you have two divs , one over the other , and the one on top is transparent . however , when you scroll you want the div on the bottom to hide as it goes under the first transparent div. you do n't want the second div 's to change to as soon as it goes under the first div. you just want the part that is under to be hidden . i 've googled extensively for an answer : # - answer make the div on top or . the problem with this for me is my background is a photograph , i.e. as you scroll down what you see is different , as opposed to a colour or a pattern . the " background " of the transparent div needs to change as the real background changes . # offers a solution to this using jquery however there are horrible , horrible issues with scroll lag in browsers not firefox . folks , how do i do it ?

__label__anger	flexmonkey may be more of a pain than it is worth . gorrilla logic claims it works with custom components but i have found this is not the case . anything with a renderer seems to have serious problems . it is a lot harder to set up tests than they claim and the tests are n't stable . i have written tests for one component times now using hardcoded ids . sometimes it just ca n't see the component and it dies . they only have short paragraphs explaining tests in their user guide and they only respond to questions about how to set it up on their google group . i would avoid using this .
__label__anger	come on , you are worrying about efficiency while your first line of code is incorrect !
__label__anger	i really hate jquery , your code looks as if you are looking forward to publishing your project finalized with jquery .. anyhow … if your looking to replace the jquery selector $ ( "" ) with a function you should know that the function requires that it returns a dom element . otherwise an error will be flagged and java script with abort .

__label__anger	i recently worked on a product that was targeted to . net . out of hundreds of beta testers , i can probably count on one hand the number that already had . net . the rest had to sit through the absolutely painful . net install from microsoft ( ~ minutes , and most of the time the progress bar stays near so people think it is broken ) .
__label__anger	so i have also ran into this problem . i have found a solution ( it 's terrible , be warned ! ) open unity and load your solution in monodevelop ( older version you can set the target framework more easily ) navigate to your project directory and open " assembly - csharp - vs " in notepad . change the line " targetframeworkversion " v3. to " targetframeworkversion " v4. you will have to do these steps every time you load unity ( blah ) but it does work .
__label__anger	@joranbeasley you 're right for the new format though … and i totally hate it ☹️
__label__anger	the answer does not establish the same 's as adding directly to the ajax call . so in order for jquery to do this properly i add this : where is a global variable . unfortunately , i have to write this extra line on every single ajax call . terrible ! maybe i 'll edit the jquery framework to handle this …
__label__anger	i am experiencing exactly this problem ( and am in exactly the same world of pain ) : whereby i am offering an update to sql using linqtosql and it is failing with a because is set to . due to legacy databases also on the server i am targeting , i am not able to re-configure the default connection settings as is quite rightly stated in the accepted answer in . my question is : how do you convince linqtosql to run a sql before executing an update ?
__label__anger	( really awful title . ) anyway : can i somehow make scala infer the type of in 2nd line ? this works as expected after adding the type : and is certainly the expected type :
__label__anger	do n't use it . i hate std::pair exactly for this reason . you never know which is which , and since access to first and second are public you ca n't enforce contracts either . but after all , it 's a matter of taste .
__label__anger	no you ca n't . that awful thing does n't work in managed mode or mixed mode .
__label__anger	yuck , i really hate that option . but option is the way to do it . upvote for option .
__label__anger	what is that downvote ? it 's real and valid question , and i hate drm too !
__label__anger	tools - > options - > projects & solutions - > build and run " on run , when projects are out of date : " select " always build " that 's it , had it myself , extremely annoying .
__label__anger	instead of loading everything which is neither possible nor really desirable i would use a sliding window instead - when you reach a certain maximum list size ( say i.e. items ) you automatically remove the top items when you add the next items to the bottom . if you scroll just right after the update this should n't even be noticeable by your users .
__label__anger	c is a cruel master !
__label__anger	do n't want to beat a dead horse , but it is really important that you understand that this is a terrible idea .
__label__anger	i really despise swfobject for this very reason . maybe you could give a try
__label__anger	you should be able to add the attribute during onprerender ( ) . inamingcontainer is so painful sometimes …
__label__anger	unless there is a very valid reason , passwords should hashed . hashes result in fixed length strings . there is not space argument to make , unless the system is storing the actual password , which is arguably a terrible idea .
__label__anger	this is a disgustingly horrible hack , but it might get the job done :
__label__anger	@anyone who uses assembla - is it 200mb per project or 200mb per account ? if it 's per account , then that 's awfully small .
__label__anger	i 've searched this and can not find it . i 've tried different plugins and different browsers ( firefox , opera , and chrome ) . i 've tried most of the no flash plugins for each of those as well as disabling flash plugins / addons in the settings . i also renamed the file in i found by searching the system . when i renamed it , makes firefox and chrome ask to install flash , but still : returns : i 'm not sure what else to try without uninstalling flash , but that will be a total pain in the ass for this . i also really do n't want to use swfobject just to see if flash is at all installed which i can do simply with : any ideas ?
__label__anger	no , it is extremely bad idea .
__label__anger	i really hate to answer my own question but i found the problem and the report is opening as of right now . i only came across this by chance but it seemed to work . i changed the setting of display on sharepoint site to do not display . i never noticed that option before so i gave it a try . sharepoint is on the laptop which i did n't know at the time and i know nothing about it , but at least it shows on the screen now .
__label__anger	to push it to heroku , you 'll have to add it to your repo . why do n't you want to commit it ? it 's recommended to commit gemfile . lock in your repo ( unless you 're developing a gem ) : when developing an app , check in your gemfile . lock , since you will use the bundler tool across all machines , and the precision enforced by bundler is extremely desirable for applications .
__label__anger	every time i download the zip file it is corrupted !
__label__sadness	( lack of line breaks in comments is saddening ! )
__label__sadness	i just got through this exact problem . what a pain ! if you are running a - bit jvm on a - bit windows , make sure that you set the execution policy for the - bit powershell interface . i found my bit executable here : the - and - bit powershell environments are completely distinct so setting the execution policy in one has no effect on the other .
__label__sadness	some more depressing news here : http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewcontent.do ? externalid = tn_14213
__label__sadness	does it make sense to start learning javafx if i do not have any background in ui programming ? is it more advisable to learn swing first and then move on to javafx ? i tried the on javafx website in netbeans and the code looked extremely complicated to me . i am wondering if javafx is too advanced for a beginnner gui developer .
__label__sadness	i 'm very sad now ☹️
__label__sadness	eruby is an external executable , while erb is a library within ruby . you would use the former if you wanted independent processing of your template files ( e.g. quick - and - dirty php replacement ) , and the latter if you needed to process them within the context of some other ruby script . it is more common to use erb simply because it is more flexible , but i 'll admit that i have been guilty of dabbling in eruby to execute files for quick little utility websites .
__label__sadness	you 're looking for an equivalent of and i 'm afraid it does n't exist explicitely in the stl. go for sebastien 's answer if it is correct for your stl implementation .
__label__sadness	this is a method in java , that ( when k == ) in int [ ] arr has one of k - combination int [ ] intems . in variable iloczyn is calculated product of elements in this combination . in tmp is calculated sum of all such products . unfortunately , system.out.println ( tmp ) shows , that when function ends , tmp equals . this is very sad , because i need this variable for next calculations . what shoud i do ?
__label__sadness	this probably sounds really stupid but i have noo idea how to implement jquery 's rounded corners ( ) . my javascript - fu is complete fail and i ca n't seem to get it to work on my page . can anyone show me a simple example of the html and javascript you would use to get them to show ? apologies for my idiocy .
__label__sadness	i know that ilist is the interface and list is the concrete type but i still do n't know when to use each one . what i 'm doing now is if i do n't need the sort or findall methods i use the interface . am i right ? is there a better way to decide when to use the interface or the concrete type ?
__label__sadness	might be an answer , but i 'm afraid i ca n't speak from experience .
__label__sadness	that 's sad :-( i do n't need it for debugging , i need it for other purpose .
__label__sadness	ohh , well this is sad ! i found the error and it unfortunately just was a typographical error …
__label__sadness	would one be violating the the terms of agreement with google app engine if one were to use amazon 's s3 service with google app engine ? i do know there is restrictions on what you can and ca n't do but i was not sure of this . having these two combined features , one could provide one heck of a system at a relatively low cost compared to hosting this with a hosting company . has anyone done this already or have heard of an application that combines the two technologies ?
__label__sadness	that is really sad ☹️
__label__sadness	that 's just a character requirement with an optional character afterwards : the parentheses may not be required - i 'm not enough of a regex guru to know offhand , i 'm afraid . if anyone wants to edit it , do feel free …
__label__sadness __label__fear	that what i was afraid of ! cause my knowledge about ajax is zero ☹️
__label__love __label__surprise	wow ! this question is more than a year old ! thanks for the answer , however i have resolved the issue ! upvote for the well documented answer .
__label__anger __label__sadness	indeed , i hate it ! but sadly no , i could not find an alternative … sorry ☹️
__label__love __label__joy	+ for this 🙂 you made my day ! ! when writing the question i was not sure if it was related to " brook 's mythicalman month " and skipped it . here i go ... and it 's persisted for eternity on stackoverflow 🙂 i am really " rofl " that stackoverflow can answer questions like this !
__label__love __label__joy	excellent ! glad that sorted it
__label__love __label__joy	excellent ! thank you for your perseverence 🙂
__label__love __label__joy	i really enjoy the !
__label__love __label__joy	awesome - what started off as a gripe turned into a real educational experience - thanks everyone !
__label__love __label__joy	awesome ! it works
__label__joy	i have but instead of bothering them i 'd like to do it myself . i really enjoy trying new things and so far figuring all of this out has been very fun !
__label__joy	here is the working solution … tested in chrome / firefox / safari … split the setter into a separate method . working grrrrreat ! enjoy … controller : view :
__label__joy	select the cells in question and do a find and replace … find . replace / i tested it and it worked perfectly 🙂 hope that helps !
__label__joy	excellent ! i 'm glad you were able to get it work for you . best of luck with sas !
__label__joy	i had the same exception , i just installed the latest vm release and now the compilation complete successfully 🙂
__label__joy	i really enjoy using beanstalk too . i few days ago i realized an iphone app to get access to your account info on your iphone , this is the itunes link : best ! pablo
__label__joy	i have an array of words that gets shuffled into paragraphs using jquery . i 'm trying to add some commas " , " in between them . ideally i need a single comma added to every 4th word but this is beyond my modest jquery skills . this is my code : really hope you can help !
__label__joy	none of the above is exactly what i was looking for , so i wrote one . super simple to use % b in the printf !
__label__joy	i am writing a flash app that receives its data over a xmlsocket . on the testmachine that worked really fine , but now the data will be ssl secured . is there any xmlsslsocket or something similar available ? if not xmlsocket a normal sslsocket would be a great help as well .
__label__joy	first i was afraid to ask such " simple " question , but it was worth it !
__label__joy	pretty much the conclusion i came up with also !
__label__joy	there is a setting in your setup project that will " uninstall " previous versions by default , turn this flag off , then you will not have to worry !
__label__joy	i just came across the following answer on another question : hope that helps !
__label__joy	awesome ! ! ! i changed to include the " / " at beginning and it worked ! ! was that why it was not matching the app . yaml handlers ?
__label__joy	in about months from now i should be able to show you one 😛
__label__joy	the rendering issue has been fixed in ie11 . no need to worry !
__label__joy	that is great news !
__label__joy	excellent ! @vinay - kr - sharma , but i add some more code to put my month language
__label__joy	this whole db is almost entirely read only so i 'm not too worried about it changing .
__label__joy	hiya working demos for you : or both works fine : hope this helps , have a good one , cheerios ! code :
__label__joy	use if - else inside scriplet based on the currently selected language and place appropriate " td " tags . hope this is what you are looking for !
__label__joy	it 's only available privately to hardware vendors from microsoft . i think this is extremely unfortunate ( i have argued to microsoft that it would be a powerful tool for academic research , as in my uses , among other things ) . i was fortunate to have access at the time while consulting for intel and nvidia .
__label__joy	link works fine !
__label__joy	vista + latest xampp + latest xdebug . dll works fine !
__label__joy	i 've just checked that simply adding the font to the vs project 's fonts folder is enough and was worried that i 'd have to manually make these calls . fortunately , the vs project has a register = vsdrffont property , so i 'm going to assume that the installer does this automatically .
__label__joy	well , i was using the setcontrolvaluetouppercase ( ) method too soon it seems . so changing my keydown first if statement to fixed my issue . horray me ! !
__label__joy	" two jsons " < - priceless !
__label__joy	that 's funny , this is exactly what i am attempting to figure out the best way to do at the moment . i had thought of using a viewstack , but as i already have a lot of other nested viewstacks being used , i was also looking into the state tag . if anyone knows " the right thing " to do i 'll be very interested too !
__label__joy	i 'll suppose that field ( ) is a function that you 've created to get a single field according to some conditions how about this code ? : i 'd be really amazed if this code is not working correctly good luck !
__label__joy	from a really geeky perspective , that is really cool !
__label__joy	all the places i 've worked have given me liberty with regard to development environment , although the production env . has always been some brand of linux - usually rh or centos . i personally use windows for dev. , and i would n't use anything else . you spend way less time debugging the os , and more time coding . this makes management much happier ! ( php developer mostly )
__label__joy	faststrings is leaps and bounds faster than the normal delphi stringreplace function . i really hope peter releases a new version for delphi .
__label__joy	i started to be thrilled only to find out that the example is ascii art !
