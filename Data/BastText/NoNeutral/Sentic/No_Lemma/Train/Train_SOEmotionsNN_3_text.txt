__label__joy	i can only repeat what others have said . parametrized sql is the way to go . sure , it is a bit of a pain in the butt coding it - but once you have done it once , then it is n't difficult to cut and paste that code , and making the modifications you need . we have a lot of . net applications that allow web site visitors specify a whole range of search criteria , and the code builds the sql select statement on the fly - but everything that could have been entered by a user goes into a parameter .

__label__anger	i have a method that does a bunch of things ; amongst them doing a number of inserts and updates . it 's declared thusly ‚Ä¶ it works exactly as it is supposed to and i have no problems with it . there are situations however when i want to force the rollback in spite of there not being an exception ‚Ä¶ at the moment , i 'm forcing an exception when i encounter the right conditions , but it 's ugly and i do n't like it . can i actively call the rollback somehow ? the exception calls it ‚Ä¶ i 'm thinking maybe i can too .
__label__love	i am looking to have an embedded youtube video with several images below it that correspond to different youtube videos . i want to set it up so that when an image is clicked on , the video above changes to whichever video corresponds with the clicked image . an implementation of this can be seen here : i am trying to implement this into a wordpress site and i really only have skill in html and css. i would very greatly appreciate if someone could help me with the code for this !

__label__anger	oh , how i hate iframes ! ! !

__label__surprise	my work just gave me a quad core computer , and wow build times are fast ! ( what used to take + minutes now takes minutes ) . anyway , visual studio builds project in parallel ( great for build times ) , but scrambles the output : is there a plugin that sorts the output when the build is complete ?
__label__sadness	i know that ilist is the interface and list is the concrete type but i still do n't know when to use each one . what i 'm doing now is if i do n't need the sort or findall methods i use the interface . am i right ? is there a better way to decide when to use the interface or the concrete type ?
__label__anger	so im using a simple submit binding to pass a function data : i just started working with ko so i was to write a basic print function to test this input out : my problem is when i hit submit i get a " you entered : undefined " but when i refresh the page the input that is in the form gets an alert . this is very frustrating ! idk if this is a knockout problem or a simple html one .
__label__anger	@joranbeasley you 're right for the new format though ‚Ä¶ and i totally hate it ‚òπÔ∏è

__label__anger	this is n't worthy of an " answer " , but i thought i 'd mention : many of the interfaces i 've really enjoyed have been minimalistic -- there 's almost nothing for me to see . like quicksilver for os x.

__label__joy	if you read the fb . init documentation , there are some parameters that can be used while defining . one of the parameter is which - determines whether xfbml tags used by social plugins are parsed , and therefore whether the plugins are rendered or not . defaults to false . you said that in case of pure javascript the like plugin worked that 's beacause you must have set to . to get your jquery code to work simply define this paramter to true which is false by default - and it shall work . good luck !
__label__joy	agile development ca n't be sold using documentations . instead , ask your management to let you be agile on a small pilot projet . for this pilot project , you must : - find a motivated end user to help you . - be free not to use the standard developping processes of your company . then , succeed ! ! !
__label__sadness	i am sorry to say this but most silverlight grids do not support cell merging . at least not out of the box . i have resorted to using component one studio for silverlight in order to achieve this , and even then it has n't been exactly a walk in the park . consider c1 data grid control . here is a sample on with sample code and a small write up . the down side of such solutions is that c1's controls are extremely expensive ‚òπÔ∏è i wish micro$oft came up with some enhancements in sl5 that would accommodate for such issues .

__label__sadness __label__fear	when you call " su " you 're creating a new process that runs that command , so after running exec ( " su " ) you have a new process with su rights . you ca n't give your already running application su rights i 'm afraid ! i 'm not sure how other applications do this , but you can run " su - l ls / data " and then read from the outputstream of the process .

__label__joy	it would be a good practice to have a separate button that will disable method since it is very easy to get confused when using your program if the code for disabling and enabling this method is all written in one method named so i suggest you separate them to make the program 's design more precise . next thing you can do is to execute a , whic you are going to mark as . after having done this you can use . here 's how : be warned that it 's sometimes dangerous to throw exceptions as it creates some other bugs , but this option wo n't hurt much if you 're just trying to disable a function . by the way , this will really not remove the method as it will just replace it , it 's now up to you to choose which method will receive this . hope this was helpful !

__label__joy	what you can do here is hide the button that pushes the view that only instructors can see , if the user is logged in is of type student . in the view that has the button that pushes the view that only instructors can use do this:in the . h file create a property for the button that pushes the view like so : in the . m file:in the viewwillappear method of the view do the following check : this way , when the view loads , the button that pushes the instructor view will only be accessible to the users of type " instructor " .hope it helps !

__label__anger	i have an android app that looks absolutely horrible if the user sets their font size to large or extra large ( via settings - > display - > font size in ice cream sandwich ) . it just plain was n't designed for variable font sizes , and it makes a lot of the text unreadable . i 've seen applications that preserve the font size for most views , so i know that there has to be a way to do this . is there a simple way for me to tell the application to ignore the user 's font size preference ? and if there is n't , how would you suggest that i go about calculating the font sizes ? if nothing else , is there a way for me to retrieve the user 's font size preference ?

__label__love	great question , wondering it myself !
__label__fear	in my mental model of authentication , a user should be distinct from the way they log in. so for example , a user could have an associated emaillogin ( with an email / password ) , or they could have many ( or none ) . similarly they could have ‚Ä¶* associated openidlogin credentials . are there any existing authentication libraries for rails which use this method ? alternatively , is this a really terrible idea ?

__label__anger	i personally only use the ' m ' and the ' p ' . the rest is just zany in my view . it makes the code so darn hard to decipher . i did maintenance work on this guy 's code who used semi-hungarian notation type id prefixes on every variable , function , and other identifier in the code . he used $ signs liberally to separate words . it was hard to keep the murderous rage in check .

__label__anger	is not an , it 's a basic type . you can only add nsobject - derived objects to an nsarray . the exc_bad_access is probably because , under the covers , it 's trying to access an object stored at wherever your int is pointing to . in other words , it 's using your int as a pointer to an nsobject and failing horribly when it does so .

__label__anger	usability notes : personally i hate when sites put the " forgot password " or " forgot username " or " help " links inbetween the password field , and the login button . as a keyboard user , i should n't have to tab over them to get to the submit button . better yet , also capture the enter keypress on the password field so that i can auto-submit with the enter key .

__label__anger	‚òπÔ∏è this is a well - known css bug in ie6 . afaik the workaround ( it 's horrible , shield your eyes ) is to put an iframe underneath your menu so that the iframe obscures the improperly z - indexed select . it 's so very horrible . but jquery is here to the rescue , as always :
__label__anger	too bad this behavior is n't a setting . i think it makes sense in theory why they did it this way , but in practice it 's just really annoying
__label__anger	i am getting very strange flickering on a wpf application of mine . it only happens with alpha blended content , only on my computer , and only with wpf applications . at least i have n't noticed it with anything else . it 's really annoying ! has anyone else dealt with this weirdness ?

__label__anger	@martinho : indeed . but you have to learn an awful lot of c ++ to understand wtf type traits do , and what the corresponding syntax means !
__label__anger	in sublime text , if i press escape the page goes into command mode , which seems to take text input as commands , rather than actually typing the text . another oddity is the visual mode , and i have no idea what it does besides it seems to highlight text . i think they came installed with the theme that i got , ' soda ' , maybe . anyway , i searched and found out you can turn off command mode by pressing ' i ' . regardless , both of these modes are extremely annoying , how do i get rid of them ?

__label__anger	i am new to delphi ( been programming in it for about months now ) . so far , it 's been an extremely frustrating experience , most of it coming from how bad delphi is at handling dates and times . maybe i think it 's bad because i do n't know how to use tdate and ttime properly , i do n't know . here is what is happening on me right now : that 's not the exact code i use , everything is in variables and used in another context , but i think you can see the problem . why is that calculation wrong ? how am i suppose to work around this problem ?

__label__sadness	ok , i find the reason : device wo n't answer to simple user ( and does n't matter what permissions did you ask in program manifest ) . you can directly speak to device only if you are root ( or from kernel mode ) . that means you can not use devices directly from general applications . very sad ‚òπÔ∏è

__label__anger	well asp . net is problematic by itself in many ways . i can only imagine how the page is coded , but mostly asp . net submits are done in a very painful way through _ dopostback where it sets additional hidden fields . you might want to try reading this and reviewing the generated html of the page
__label__anger	this was one area of c that the designers got terribly badly wrong !

__label__anger	can you help ? i have a db , the unique identifiers are guids - we need to implement url rewriting however the page names look terrible for example : testpage-2668ff87-0a3a-4cac-b9ab-2367d17a76c3.aspx title of page / unique identifier my db 's that i setup i use ints as unique identifiers so i never had this problem : testpage- .aspx title of page / unique identifier ( int ) what do you suggest ?

__label__anger	i am building the android os on mac osx ( lion ) , and eclipse as an ide . i am trying to understand certain parts of the os however this requires performing many searches throughout the project . these searches take or minutes on eclipse , and the way they are presented is also extremely annoying . also , i need a separate editor to open up the native files found in the os , since if they are opened in eclipse there is no color coding of the c ++ syntax . i feel that eclipse is really slowing me down - can anyone suggest a better ide for browsing the android os ( preferably free ) ?
__label__anger	poor steve just got screwed over by people not reading what he wrote correctly . i hate it when that happens , but i can understand why they read it the way they did . you left the statement rather ambiguous .

__label__love __label__anger	i 'm integrating protobuf - net into our wcf services based solution but have ran into a snag that i ca n't figure out . the following class will serialize fine , all except for the objectid property . here 's the class that 's toying with me : i 've tried multiple things with no luck . any thoughts would be greatly appreciated !
__label__sadness	my guess is that you would have to extend the classes for datatip , to check for null hitdata objects , to kill / stop the drawing of the display . i do not think there is a way to do that normally in flex . you would have to customize and override the hitdata class unfortunately . what a pain ! !
__label__anger	i 'm trying to debug my application and from the point i fire it up on the ipad , it will get killed by timeout before it ever reaches finishedlaunching ( ) ( i have abreakpoint there ) ! here ' swhat i see in the output panel . all this takes almost 20s . if i run the app in release build it randomly gets stuck . i hit a button and the delegate gets caled half a minute later . what is going on ? in the simulator it is all okay .
__label__anger	i 'm having an extremely frustrating error trying to code a simple encryption program on python . basically its rejecting on if / else statement by saying my syntax is invalid , and i have no idea what i did wrong . the : in the if input == " " : statement is what python highlights as incorrect .
__label__joy	wpf is a fascinating platform to develop our next generation applications on ! the ability to style just about anything , the databinding support and attached / dependency properties . wow ! but let 's not throw caution to the wind because while wpf performance is great , it 's not the best ‚Ä¶ yet . definitely is a strong contender , but as developers we are still left with design principles for our front ends .
__label__love	excellent ! thanks for the additional detail sean !
__label__sadness	i 'm not for sure how the controlcollection of asp . net works , so maybe someone can shed some light on this for me . i recently discovered the magic that is extension methods and linq . well , i was very sad to find that this is n't valid syntax however from what i can tell , does implement the interface which provides such methods , so what gives ? why does n't that just work ? i have found a decent work around for this issue at least :

__label__love	if it has a lot of cup holders , that 'd be awesome , too !
__label__joy	excellent - i 'm glad you found it ! the double quotes may be a unix / linux thing . note that oracle will accept ` username / pw@db ` or ` username@db / pw ` .

__label__love	i am using some php script to add some data from a complex form to mysql db and then showing it all in some html table . everything works just fine , but i would like to ' upgrade ' my script with jquery and ( i suppose ) ajax . what i would like to do is when user submits data , the row ( or ) shows up in the html table without refreshing a page . form and table are on same page , of course ‚Ä¶ some guidelines would be really helpful because i 'm not sure should i even use ajax or something else for my needs . links for some tutorials will be also great üôÇ thanks a lot for any help !

__label__fear	but i 'm afraid the cacheobject would get gc'ed not the data it caches .
__label__love	two excellent answers , thank you ! i chose andrew 's primarily because i learned a bit more about knockout from it , but both are good options . i 'd use rp 's method to get something to use in a more generic " anything can be chosen " scenario , but i think making it a single object is probably a better fit for my uses .

__label__joy	i have a table with a field that needs to store characters . my question is this : can you limit the length of a text field ( varchar stops at - i ca n't use it ) to characters ? if i do that , will mysql run through the table quicker due to the fixed data length , or does it act a bit like varchar in that the length can vary ? i do n't have a table ( at all ) yet , but i 'm very conscious about speed and size for the future . i found this article : incredibly useful - maybe you will to ! thanks a lot , james

__label__anger	there 's an error here : $ r3 only has one result column ( which you have n't given a name ) . are you sure you are using the correct variable because there 's no way that your code should work as you have posted it . also your variable naming is really awful . use meaningful names instead of , , etc ‚Ä¶

__label__joy	personally , if you think you can do huge amounts of refactoring , why not get the other student to come and sit with you and as you go , he / she can ask questions and maybe he / she has some ideas of their own . our industry moves fast , as i 'm sure you know , so your partner wo n't encounter other devs as forgiving as you . i 've added this as a comment because it does n't actually answer your question about unit testing . just wanted to give you something else to think about . good luck !
__label__love	i agree with pw. opal is an excellent choice . it supports audio and video devices it compiles on windows , linux , and a few others also - i recommend using the sip protocol ( as opposed to h323 ) - you do n't need to use ekiga . ekiga is a front - end to opal . you can take a look at the opal samples , and build up from those .

__label__anger	enlightenment dr16 is packaged with opensuse but it 's a bit painful to use with kde apps as there 's no obvious ( on the enlightenment site , google etc. ) way to provide a systray for kde apps that require one ( e.g. , ktorrent ) . anyone know of a way around this ? i 'm not using e for the eye - candy - i 'm running on a .6ghz celeron and kde ( ) performance is n't exactly stellar so i 'm trying out a few alternatives .

__label__anger	do n't use it . i hate std::pair exactly for this reason . you never know which is which , and since access to first and second are public you ca n't enforce contracts either . but after all , it 's a matter of taste .
__label__anger	yes definately turn off that solution wide processing . it 's a hog .
__label__joy	this is very fine üôÇ note that if you do the following : only the first element of the array will be initialized with the non-zero number whereas the rest will be initialized with zeros .

__label__surprise	whoops , just realized something‚Ä¶.there 's no way for me to specify a max length when using string . string ( sbyte *) which basically means death to using the constructor for the purpose of reading out of a ring - buffer since it could keep reading past the max length into the next segment !

__label__joy	hi there , i was able to set the focus back on the selected item after some research on similar issue . all i needed to do was , call the begininvoke method on the dispatcher property of the listbox and do the focus setting on the selecteditem in the listbox in the delegate method call which is as below : box.dispatcher.begininvoke ( dispatcherpriority.system.idle , new focus ( setfocus ) , box ) ; where focus is the delegate and setfocus is the delegate method where i get the selected item from the listbox and set focus on the corresponding listboxitem . hope this helps ! ! regards , sowmi
__label__anger	note that this does n't use a stringbuilder , so will have horrible performance for very long sequences .

__label__anger	in the end the answer was - yes - indeed . it was simply a delay between me adding my google test account and it actually being recognised as such üò° ! google should have a warning about this - in-app billing is a complete nightmare to code !

__label__anger	my nslog messages no longer show up in my debug area . anyone have an idea how the could have happened ? i can hit command- to bring of a list of logs in the left pane , select the latest one and view it in my editor window , but it is extremely annoying compared to having the console output in the debug area .

__label__anger	@wst it does n't even have the decency to return the same map ? that is really terrible .
__label__anger	ok , so what do you want me to do about that ? hint : how about * telling us * what your problem is ?
__label__love	i understand not liking xaml , as it really intimidated me at first , but i will quickly say that it is a powerful tool . i am not sure how to do it through the designer , but in c # let 's say you name your datagrid ' mydatagrid ' and your list is named ' stringlist ' . it is as simple as the following : and the data grid is now bound to your string list .
__label__love	glad to see i 'm not the only one who got that ! the free book is actually really exciting ; it will definitely motivate you to do peer code review .

__label__joy	@thorbj√£¬∏rn ravn andersen that 's really great !
__label__joy	if you handle the rowdatabound event you can check the value of the data and modify the attributes of the cell or apply a different style in that event handler . that should give you what you are looking for . let me know if you need it in vb rather than c # . good luck !
__label__anger	in my android app i 'm trying to share an open graph including an object and an action . in my facebook app i added a story : and ( is this ok ? ) . when i try to add an image to the object in the og i get above error . this is my code : here 's the logcat : what am i doing wrong ? maybe i 'm messing up some strings in the story , facebook tutorial is awful !
__label__love	an alternative to recording would be to use the ms speech api with c # , enter the words via keyboard , and have it state what was keyed in. just a thought ‚Ä¶ good luck on your app -- it sounds like a really cool program !
__label__joy	found the culprit ! at first i tried the solution suggested by @billinkc in the comment , it worked ( i managed to create a folder ) but the folder was n't usable as i could n't upload packages . i have db_owner permission on the msdb database and so i can see and access the ssis msdb folder . what i really needed was the db_ssisadmin permission . not to worry as db_owner permissions allow me to give myself the db_ssisadmin permission ! after this was done , all the problems ( the one in the original q and more ) disappeared .
__label__anger	when i apply on ( ) - handlers i prefer the following notation if i have more than one to apply : does anybody knows how to set a namespace within this notation ? i solved the problem in this case with falling back to a single notation : but i really hate to repeat myself . same issue / question for using the off ( ) - method with more than one handler . this works : i bet the off ( ) - thing is a easy one , but i do n't get it after coding the last hours .
__label__anger	i thought i 'd commented . complete rubbish http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ /performance-space-implications-when-ordering-sql-server-columns/ #
__label__joy	wow , wow , wow ! i actually found a better way to do that ‚Ä¶ if i keep the same abbreviation and change template text into : it does want i wanted , but in the way cooler way ! so you can use your own variables in a template as long as you do n't call them or awesome !

__label__anger	so i have also ran into this problem . i have found a solution ( it 's terrible , be warned ! ) open unity and load your solution in monodevelop ( older version you can set the target framework more easily ) navigate to your project directory and open " assembly - csharp - vs " in notepad . change the line " targetframeworkversion " v3. to " targetframeworkversion " v4. you will have to do these steps every time you load unity ( blah ) but it does work .
__label__love	the was a pretty awesome read / reference ! although there are some typos , etc. , it is really extensive and has tons of examples . c & c ++ .
__label__anger	unless there is a very valid reason , passwords should hashed . hashes result in fixed length strings . there is not space argument to make , unless the system is storing the actual password , which is arguably a terrible idea .

__label__love	hi derick - right now , i 'm running from the command line , and very soon we 'll have it hooked up to hudson . we 've convinced people that hudson will be fine without a physical log file from the rake execution . and i think i 've satiated the desire for log files by using the " . parameters " option on my msbuild and nunit tasks to log output . i 'm loving albacore ! you guys did a great job with it .
__label__love	yes , as a number of the excellent responses spotted , it is ( was ) a homebrew fiber implementation - my first implementation of flow - based programming on a pc. the - bit version was actually used for production work at a big us company . i did n't realize that win32 has a fibers implementation - i 'll read the article cited by greg hewgill . thanks to all of you !
__label__love	thank you for the excellent answers ! @arnoldspence is correct : it is indeed a case of memory fragmentation . i confirmed this by modifying my example above to allocate a series of mb buffers after the reaching the " out of memory " condition . sure enough , these all succeeded ( up to the 2gb limit ) .
__label__love	+ . brian , you saved me from hours and hours of research , great insight !

__label__anger	sorry , most of the code for this is 3rd party and i do not have access to it , making things extremely difficult / frustrating .
__label__love	@ryanc : excellent ! now i understand what is going on , rather than just thrashing , as before . i think your explanation ( about the canvas ignoring ` refresh - now ` before it is open ) is very sensible .

__label__love __label__joy	excellent ! exactly what i needed üôÇ
__label__sadness	i ran into the same thing a few years ago with a pi system , so i do feel your pain !
__label__love	very good point ! i 've changed my example code .
__label__anger	i absolutely hate cluttered seed files . admittedly , it 's a personal preference and not a right or wrong . here 's what i did in my app at work to handle the significant volume of seed data we are required to use : my seeds . rb file : a sample seed file in the seeds / folder : this has the effect of loading our seed files in the desired order ( using _ then _ , etc. ) . it also breaks up our seeds into logical groupings and organizes them in such a way that , for our team , we can more easily manage them .
__label__love	excellent , thanks for reporting back !
__label__joy	i figured out , way of calling the hub was not correct . for the time being i have modified my code as in global . asax :- works absolutely fine now üôÇ still figuring out better alternatives ! ! ! !

__label__love	excellent workaround ‚Ä¶ !
__label__joy	indeed your question is an easy one , so i answer your question with some additional points that i think help you more than the answer itself:first , this is the code : notes : please1 - do n't a simple problem a real hard one ! if it 's a hw you can convince the tutor about defining the string delimited with something like " , " ( if he / she insists ) or whatever , and if this is a real project convince the customer , you do n't want to torture yourself ! - you said you want to split the string into a x matrix , what if you want a 5x5 matrix ? so take advantage of constants , and the same for the delimiter hope these help .

__label__joy	i 'm just getting my feet wet with multiprocessing ( and its totally awesome ! ) , but i was wondering if there was any guidelines to selecting number of processes ? is it just based on number of cores on the server ? is it somehow based on the application your running ( number of loops , how much cpu it uses , etc ) ? etc‚Ä¶.how do i decide how many processes to spawn ? right now , i 'm just guessing and add / removing processes but it would be great if there was some kind of guideline or best practice . another question , i know what happens if i add too few ( program is slooow ) but what if i add ' too many ' ? thanks !
__label__love	yes , i have just installed binutils and it 's looking very awesome ! ! ! i 'm going to check it out ! bb with more info
__label__love	i 'm absolutely loving breezejs and was so surprised to see that my enum values were being displayed as their text values and not their ordinal ones ! what i would love to be able to do is , on the client side , open the metadatastore , fetch the enumeration and modify it 's textual properties for display purposes . is this currently possible ? from my research it would appear not , but i 'm wondering if there is perhaps a simple workaround . everything i 've tried has involved a large number of hacks and server - side attributes , but to no avail , or the solution just seemed overly complex and not worth the benefits .
__label__sadness	the solution is crying out for the msmq solution but unfortunately the posting service is not on the domain . is there anyway to post to the public queue that is on the domain from the machine in the dmz ? i could use a webservice to post but this is a extra component to maintain . the database table is the alternative solution but again it is not the ideal .

__label__fear	my application links against libsamplerate.a . i am doing this to make distributing the final binary easier . i am worried that perhaps the code inside the . a file depends on some other libraries i also will need to distribute . but if it does n't i am worried i am bloating up my application too much by including multiple copies of eg . libc . what exactly will be inside libsamplerate.a ? just libsamperate 's bytecode ? or more ?

__label__anger	@chris two different control statements just to appease developers who want their switch statements to work in a slightly different way ? that 's a ** terrible ** idea . vb [ had that mentality for loops ] ( http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/visual_basic/loops), and it worked out terribly .

__label__love	upvote saves a lot of time when unit testing data access layers . just note that ts will often need msdtc which might not be desirable ( depending on whether your app will need msdtc )
__label__love	@r ‚Ä¶ wow ! really great answer ! ! you should post it as an answer here , as it 's really more precise . just a question , though , when you say round for the alignment of the type , you mean that if for example on your example you had a short b instead of int b , it would be aligned to offset , instead of ?
__label__love	i 'd say spike should be part of the iteration plan . not just in time . they should be accounted for the story they belong to . even reading of parts of the manual should be estimated . and now for the hard part : do n't be afraid to give high estimates . realistic is always better than too low . üòâ

__label__anger	i built an xml - rpc server in python using simplexmlrpcserver , according to the example in the python documentation . i 'm calling it from a python client on the same machine . the body of the server function executes very fast on its own . but i find that xmlrpc client performance is excruciatingly slow , taking one second per call .

__label__anger	one thing i forgot , make sure the dev database you are running the migration from ( the sql server database ) is updated from production immediately before each test run . hate to have something fail on prod because you were testing against outdated records .
__label__love	i always recommend for a good starting point for beginners - especially those who have seen sql but never understood how to build up a query them selves or how they work . all celko 's books are great . hernandez 's mere mortals book is good . ken henderson 's books are also excellent .
__label__anger	for various reasons microsoft decides that some info should be kept away from developers . but people through reverse engineering find out what these reserved fields are about and produce their own documentation . some times people guess correct . some times microsoft makes breaking changes , and people scream " how dare you !

__label__anger	i completely disagree with the answers so far . i feel that internal is a horrid idea , preventing another assembly from inheriting your types , or even using your internal types should the need for a workaround come about . today , i had to use reflection in order to get to the internals of a system.data.datatable ( i have to build a datatable lightning fast , without all of its checks ) , and i had to use reflection , since not a single type was available to me ; they were all marked as internal .

__label__anger	the problem is exact what mysql is telling you : you have too much data for one table . not only the number of fields are counting towards them , but also their size ‚Ä¶ but the real problem is in your database design , you have designed a table that is crying out for help : ' split me up , split me up !

__label__love	great tutorial . really appreciate it !

__label__anger	is defined on the document and you might not even have a variable ( it 's a property of , not of ) . change to but you must learn how to spot those bugs , by which lists errors . and using is a terribly painful way to track your bugs , use .

__label__anger	as title , basically i have a user control placed inside a page and then the page is placed inside the master page . i want to extract a block of javascript and put it back to the page head . when i try to wrap the code inside any block control ( e.g. a div runat server ) and access divid . innertext then asp . net bust off with i do nt want to extract js inside cs file , that s awfully ugly approach ( all sort of escapes and people wo nt even notice you have js written unless they drill your cs file ) , what can i do ?
__label__love	excellent , thanks to both of you !
__label__anger	reinnstalled xcode4 - same thing . awful !
__label__anger	c is a cruel master !
__label__love	your implementation looks absolutely fine to me ! a range - based away subscript is a type for performance reasons . it does not copy the indicated sub-array , instead it just points to the range defined by the you provide to the subscript .
__label__anger	that 's a really terrible way to read in all your files . try this : this will return a list of data frames , each of which is the contents of the corresponding file . or , if there are other csv files that you do n't want to read in , you can restrict the specification : and to combine everything into one big data frame :
__label__anger	nobody answers here .. sad ! ! !
__label__anger	we ended up using a java applet . it was a nightmare . normally it would have been awful , but as this was for the beijing olympics , the added distance & language differences made it a nightmare . in the end , it worked " enough . " but again , nightmare . i would not recommend it .
__label__love	your best bet is probably tcpclient . there 's a great sample that does exactly what you 're doing right in the . net documentation here : good luck to you !
__label__fear	i used multiple requests - batches of . i do n't want to anger the api !
__label__love	excellent ! this should be marked as an answer . very good solution .
__label__joy	i am writing a flash app that receives its data over a xmlsocket . on the testmachine that worked really fine , but now the data will be ssl secured . is there any xmlsslsocket or something similar available ? if not xmlsocket a normal sslsocket would be a great help as well .
__label__anger	i really hate when this happens ‚Ä¶ i search and search for an answer and then i post a question . then minutes later i find the answer ‚Ä¶ the answer was on line ‚Ä¶ this let me make the call ‚Ä¶ i mean i get a pile of junk on the screen , but it does n't fail ‚Ä¶ no exception .
__label__surprise	great ! i do n't know why but accepted answer is not working . do you know why ?
__label__love	excellent ! i got it working with your help .
__label__love	that 's great ! thanks a lot for the tip !
__label__love	although i did n't technically end up escaping the dot , your suggestion actually did make me realize another alternative . while wondering how i would " pass " the escape code to the " sql " server , it dawned on me : why not use a " sql pass - through query " instead of an odbc linked table ? since i only need read access to the sql server data , it works fine ! thanks !
__label__fear	i am working on iphone app , at once it started showing me error , with no exception , i am really afraid of this error , can any one tell me why this is happening ?
__label__sadness	that 's very sad ‚òπÔ∏è
__label__sadness	a ( it does n't have to be a class ; structs and interfaces can be partial too ) is basically a single type which has its code spread across multiple files . the main use for this is to allow a code generator ( e.g. a visual studio designer ) to " own " one file , while hand - written code is put in another . i 've no idea whether python / perl have the same capabilities , i 'm afraid .
__label__anger	is search and replace the only way to rename as asp control in the code behind file ? i find this extremely annoying , but it is the only way i can find . scenario : i 'll find a variable that needs renaming ( usually to meet naming convention ) i 'll rename the variable in the aspx / ascx file . i 'll have to go in the code behind files and search and replace . i get annoyed are there any better ways - preferably that would not touch a similarly named variable in another scope in the project . i 'm on vs2008 with resharper -- does vs2010 address this perhaps ?
__label__love	i 'm wondering how boxcar works , anybody knows ? i know how to do the push notification from server to iphone , but i have no clue of how to create the server to get the @reply and dm from twitter in real time . any suggestion on what i should look into to create the server ? should i use twitter 's streaming api or user streams api ? any sample code , in php preferably , will be great üôÇ thanks !

__label__joy	i m really excited to know that html has in build support for audio and video playback ( i know its old news but i just woke up ! üòõ ) . what is even more exciting is that it can play local audio / video files in matters of some click . i had a look at this , could not find any offline video player . my question is why is that people are not developing an offline media player which could just be loaded form a website ? are there some issues ? thanks
__label__love	upvote for this question - i have the same issue .

__label__love	upvote for " do n't believe into the myths that there are a lot of issues with ms access "
__label__anger	i guess i could do that . it 's just a pain when in microsoft word i can hold down shift and drag to do this , but i ca n't in visual studio !
__label__anger	i 'll bet you that your main 's function signature is incorrect . you use : but sdl_main.h wants aside : you see , sdl does something really horrific when compiling : it renames your function to , injecting its own main function which , in turn , calls yours . note that if this does n't work , then you may be compiling with wrong flags . to be sure , take the flags by running : for more information , see

__label__anger	the dreadful integer arithmetic attacks again ! when you calculate (( + + ) / ) , since all the operands are integers , ruby uses integer arithmetic rather than floating point arithmetic . if you do / it will also return , as it 's rounded down to the nearest integer , which is .

__label__fear	i am about to alter the several tables in a massive system which i probably only understand around % . i want to add three columns . one of these is just a rename of an existing column . part of me wants to :- rename the column but worried about the impact on unknown parts of the system that use the old name . append the three columns to the table therefore making the old column redundant ( over time ) .
__label__sadness __label__fear	sorry ! had some syntax issue , i fixed it and it works now‚Ä¶.what should i do with the question ?

__label__anger	schemas - okay , has owners , but they can be a real pain to get permissions right on .
__label__love	btw - your article on " the math behind transforms " is an excellent read - very helpful indeed !
__label__sadness	i 've updated the fiddle . i had to use classes to get it to work , so its not % perfect imo .
__label__love	svg transform on text attribute works excellent ! this snippet , for example , will increase your text by 2x at y - axis .
__label__joy	i have no clue if this approach would be feasible or not , but then there are two things you could try : .create a singleton class where you and the arraylist . the class might look like this : to access the list you could write : is the name of the getter method and before getting it set it . else you might get . also a receiver might start before the list is filled . so always check for null before you use it. .the other option is you store the list in a cache object like check for even in this case in the broadcast receiver before using it . hope that helps !
__label__love	excellent - thanks !
__label__love	i see . everything makes sense now . thanks a lot for the excellent answers !
__label__joy	i second trying to put the whole path instead . for relative paths , if you 're doing compiling and running in command line / terminal , you need to have that studentrecords . txt in the same directory of your code files . if you 're using an ide , you need to put your studentrecords . txt under the src / folder . this is assuming you 're not in maven project setup ; otherwise it should be put under / src / main / java / resources / . hope this helps !
__label__love	wow , it works ! thanks .
__label__love	it 's not a place , but i 've found by charles petzold excellent . it covers everything you ask about and is focused specifically on wpf / silverlight . of course petzold ( as usual ) is able to communicate the important concepts beautifully .
__label__joy	excellent ! it 's very useful to me !
__label__anger	i tested this code out with an access database with no exceptions ( i went as high as inserts ) . however , what i noticed is that it is terribly slow as you are creating a connection every time . if you put the " using ( connection ) " outside the loop , it goes much faster .

__label__love	if you do n't mind working at a slightly lower level , httplib2 ( ) is an excellent http library that includes caching functionality .
__label__anger	i recently worked on a product that was targeted to . net . out of hundreds of beta testers , i can probably count on one hand the number that already had . net . the rest had to sit through the absolutely painful . net install from microsoft ( ~ minutes , and most of the time the progress bar stays near so people think it is broken ) .
__label__love	excellent ! thanks for telling me about this . i 'll be watching this .
__label__joy	yes - that feature is extremely useful for writing upgrade scripts .
__label__fear	i would be extremely shocked if this was possible .
__label__anger	for sql server , i always had to install the full product first , then express second . if i did it the other way around , the full sql install would see express installed already , and would not continue with the install . it was extremely annoying . not sure if they fixed this with .
__label__anger	to push it to heroku , you 'll have to add it to your repo . why do n't you want to commit it ? it 's recommended to commit gemfile . lock in your repo ( unless you 're developing a gem ) : when developing an app , check in your gemfile . lock , since you will use the bundler tool across all machines , and the precision enforced by bundler is extremely desirable for applications .
__label__love	there 's for a sort that should work , but just was n't included in the core . referenced from , i think you just pass in a function that is used to sort , like so hope it helps !
__label__joy	excellent questions ! this particular project will need ds , wayf , etc.

__label__joy	just use rotateflip : as @dan - o has pointed out , this allows a rotation of any of the degree 's in the enum . to rotate a bitmap any angle without losing the size , you could do the following , but it 's a bit convoluted ! one - add the library to your project two - add the xaml , windowsbase and presentationcore libraries to your project three - use the following to rotate your bitmap any amount of degrees : pain in the ass , but works !

__label__joy	if you are on 11g you are in luck üôÇ you can use select for update skip locked in the cursor - then you are guaranteed that two threads will never get the same row on a fetch ! the right way to do this in oracle would be advanced queueing - since this will solve all your problems , provides synchronization und parallel execution and other benefits‚Ä¶.before oracle and without advanced queuing ( if you really want to code it yourself ‚Ä¶ ) you can do it like this :( the bits marked with autonomous transaction have to be called in a separate method as an autonomous transaction . if the update returns rows it can either be because the table is empty , or because two threads accessed the same row . - so we need a separate ending condition counting available rows .

__label__anger	it 's technically possible to achieve this in t-sql with nested loops and embedded queries . all hugely ugly in t-sql . far easier to do it in a language that 's more general purpose .

__label__love	loving susy , so far ! now i 'd like this initial layout ‚Ä¶ to turn into this layout on a smaller screen : is this possible using susy ? furthermore , i 'd want the ac - column to function as a single entity when they 're in the same column , since i 'd like to give them sticky behavior .
__label__anger	i 've tried with postsharp , but their current implementation targets , and it 's getting painful to make it work . should i roll out my own aop implementation ( i 'm thinking of a very very basic and utilitarian implementation here ) or there is an alternative i 'm not aware of ?
__label__love	upvote , excellent explanation !
__label__love	you can easily define a comparator for a one - level , so that lookup becomes way less cumbersome . there is no reason of being afraid of that . the comparator defines an ordering of the _ key template argument of the map . it can then also be used for the multimap and set collections . an example :
__label__anger	i 'm just going through the same process ! i was looking at this page : http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/connecting.html which starts talking about coffee shops ! at that point i gave up . you 've got to love java / oracle documentation !
__label__love	i have a mobile web page with a table containing many rows . each row has additional information . ideally , when a user taps on each row , a new layer will display , covering the whole screen , that provides more information for each row . the layer can be closeable by tapping on the new layer itself . is this something i can do with a to begin with ? or do these rows need to be divs instead ? please if someone could push me along , that would be excellent ! thanks .
__label__anger	getting the ssrs add - in to install properly was a complete pain . i think it had to do with the fact that we did development on the server prior to installing the ssrs add - in. i ended up un-joining the farm , re-joining it , then installing the component . that got it to work . then i just had to re-deploy solutions , re-activate features and re-configure my web . config .

__label__anger	does anyone commit qt to their own source control ? if so , how do you do it ? do you commit the whole qt directory or do you pick only the ones that your application needs ( bin / lib / include / src ) how do you handle the case when new qt version comes out ? i 'm asking because i 'm trying to setup build automation and qt moc is a bit of a pain‚Ä¶.and just wondering how people handle committing 3rd party library in general .

__label__anger	any progress on this one ? to embed complex functionality ( including history - aware interactivity ) on an mvc page without involving the rest of the page is a reasonable and common desire . the only alternative i see , to require the using page to track each components query - string state , is horrible .

__label__love	jim did a great job !
__label__sadness	a unit test should do the same thing every time that it runs , otherwise you may run into a situation where the unit test only fails occasionally , and that could be a real pain to debug . try seeding your pseudo-randomizer with the same seed every time ( in the test , that is -- not in production code ) . that way your test will generate the same set of inputs every time . if you ca n't control the seed and there is no way to prevent the function you are testing from being randomized , then i guess you are stuck with an unpredictable unit test . ‚òπÔ∏è

__label__joy	maybe this will be of some help -
__label__anger	so , the following hack seems to work , but it 's really incredibly ugly imo , as it relies on you controlling the line - height and using absolute positioning . worse , it requires you to know how many lines there are in your text , which depends on the width of the div and the font - size , and probably requires js to compute . anyway , after all the above disclaimers , here 's the hack : use two divs with the same text , one on top of the other . one justified , one centered . then clip the justified one . html css fiddle . of course , the above code is hard - coded for the specific width . again , you 'll probably need js in order to compute the number of lines in the div. i 'm pretty sure that until this gets implemented in webkit you probably wo n't find an elegant solution for your problem .

__label__love	upvote : serialization can be a pain . this really helped me out .
__label__joy	@joe yes , if i were to declare the property and synthesize it as above , but i do n't explicitly declare an ivar myself , the compiler will still actually create the ivar . so i could do ` int len = [ self . stringproperty length ] ` as you 'd expect inside the class , and i can also do ` int len = [ stringproperty length ] ` as well , without using the accessor method , just directly using the ivar ( which the compiler has synthesized for me , along with setter + getter ) . it 's really fantastic !

__label__love	i 'm using rob con 's repository pattern also - absolutely love it . but i 'm not worrying about concurrency checks . i load the most recent object , then update the fields the submitchanges . i would look at seeing if you could use the attach and / or timestamps . it 's been a while since i 've looking into linq + concurrency .
__label__anger	im trying to work with this awful language and i have to change an item of list by accessing to it with index i do nt understand the awful syntax of tcl ! how can i realise it ?
__label__love	almost works . you have to seek to one less then write a byte , otherwise you still end up with a 0b file . still very helpful , thanks ! correct syntax too . if you want to edit , the extra line you need is outfile . writebyte ( ) ;
__label__love	great ! three solutions ( from sykora , leonard and fgm ) that make this map work . i like the one from fgm for its brevity

__label__fear	i 'm using this practice to add comments using ajax , by sending the data to an asp . net handler which collect the information and then insert the comment , but i am afraid that any one could use it , am i wrong ! ?
__label__anger	talking about feelings ‚Ä¶ i really hate the asp . net calendarextender ‚Ä¶
__label__anger	yuck , i really hate that option . but option is the way to do it . upvote for option .

__label__love __label__surprise	i agree with @rogeria . this does n't explain why it is called the ioc and i am surprised by the number of up votes üòâ
__label__love	great article 0xced , thanks !
__label__anger	do n't want to beat a dead horse , but it is really important that you understand that this is a terrible idea .
__label__joy	great ! i will take a look later . cheers .
__label__love	i know neither is true for now , but i really want these to be true . i heard that ruby - gnome2 and shoes are the top most used desktop libraries for ruby . since shoes and gtk depends on some common things , and shoes give a higher abstraction for ui , why not go a step further to merge them ? make shoes totally on top of gtk. i respect different intent of shoes ' creators , so , just a question to make me clear . thanks very much for your great job !
__label__sadness	that is very very sad
__label__anger	working with anes is an incredibly frustrating process .
__label__anger	is there a way to set " work offline " in tfs without having to try opening a solution , waiting for it to time out , and then having visual studio work out that it has failed ? it seems a touch ridiculous that i ca n't just tick a box to tell it myself , seeing as i 'm probably the one most qualified to know when i 'm not in the office !
__label__anger	how do i change the position of the sort button in header of the grid in tapestry ? i have column names of different lengths and i break lines on spaces , so the button , which is appended to the end of the column names , always ends up in different height . and that is very ugly ‚òπÔ∏è
__label__joy	excellent ! glad to hear it !
__label__anger	i ca n't help think that making xml ad xmllist both unrelated , as in both extend object directly , is a design flaw in the as3 core library . surely having xml extend xmllist would be a much cleaner system , where xml is considered an xmllist with only one member ? this would also avoid the very annoying practice of an e4x query possibly returning either an xml or xmllist , which can result in a casting error . so is there any reason i 'm not thinking of that xml and xmllist were designed to only have object as a common type ?
__label__anger	is there a way to aid gmail in making threads ? we are currently using same subjects to do this , but that really uglyfies the subject a lot .

__label__love	so i 'm trying to write a rr rotation and ll rotation with java for an avl tree . i have most of it figured out , however i do n't know where i should modify the height within the method . i 've been trying to understand it for a few days here but i can not figure out where exactly it would go in the method i currently have . if someone could help explain exactly where i should put the modifications for the height of the node ( it uses getleft / setleft for it 's left height and getright / setright for it 's right height ) it would be extremely helpful !
__label__anger	android camera stuff is extremely frustrating , i understand that . make sure to read through all of the and check out this code below referenced from :
__label__surprise	wow , would have expected a quick answer on this ! well , found my own answer : you ca n't have more than one exception with except . see the here . instead , they recommend creating a filter ‚Ä¶
__label__fear	to be honest i do n't even know where to start . i guess the solution might entail using a zillion iif statements . i 'm fairly new to this i 'm afraid !
__label__anger	i have full control of the deployment enviroment , it 's an internal intranet application . office interop / autmation is horrible , and while the documents are generated by c # , we use aspose . words . i can accept using interop . automation for printing , going to give it a try .
__label__love	how can i check if i have listed all the dependencies correctly ? the is an excellent tool for checking both build dependencies and dependencies by setting up a clean base system within a chroot environment . by compiling the package within pbuilder , you can easily check the build dependencies , and by testing it within a pbuilder environment , you can check the dependencies .
__label__anger	freeing the local array " buffer " is undefined , and probably horrible , behavior ! you ca n't free something unless it was allocated with malloc ( ) or calloc ( ) . it 's likely corrupting the heap and causing the crash .
__label__joy	what is the problem ? create additional page and add it to wp , insert code there , and make an output page whatever you want . if you know php it will take you min .
__label__joy	code contracts are pretty cool , but they do have some limitations . they will only create compiler warnings , not errors . also , this analysis is pretty slow on large projects . however , i 'm hoping this technology will evolve and eventually be integrated into the language itself . it 's incredibly promising !
__label__joy	i hope you were joking üôÇ i want to collect general statistics on my typing and specifically not log everything since i 'm sure to type passwords .
__label__love	great chart ! good find .
__label__love	hey guys . i told my wife all options that you gave and she went for " as required " , says it sounded more formal to her , and although unspecified matches the scenario too , she did n't like how it looked on the agreement . could n't mark your answer as preferred since you put it as a comment ceejayoz . but , really thank you all for the very quick answers and taking the time to help !

__label__love	its an excellent place to start !
__label__anger	i would tend to leave them open -- but open them with the file share permissions set to allow other readers and make sure you flush log output with every message . i hate programs which do n't even let you look at the logfile while they are running , or where the log file is n't flushed and lags behind what is happening .
__label__love	excellent ! thanks much .

__label__anger	my company currently use cruisecontrol . net , which i find quite a pain on the neck to configure . what ci solution do you use ?
__label__love __label__anger	i agree with ceejayoz . talk about an absolutely horrible user experience .
__label__anger	ignoring how ridiculously lame it is to ask a question and answer it in this fashion seconds later , this is an awful answer , and that is why it is voted down . why will you only see a small speedup ? can you provide numbers ? platforms tested on ? this answer is even more vague than the original question , which was vague to begin with .
__label__joy	edited my post . hope it helps ; and feel free to keep asking questions !

__label__joy	yes , you need two view controllers . check out lesson from stanfords cs193p iphone application programming course . it is available online . both slides and the lecture through itunes u. i really enjoyed watching the course !
__label__anger	from netstat - anp | grep i at two different times , i can see httpclient is not re-using my connections . i connect to the same host every time with different urls such as why is httpclient not just re-using the same connection to myhost . com every time ? i have the following code for intialization of the pool that i pass to httpclient ‚Ä¶ i see they are using an httproute and have localaddress in the equals which seems odd as httproute should be equal on just hostname and schema ( https / http ) and that is it , right ? does that have something to do with it ? is this a bug ? performance is very crappy having to re-establish https sockets every time ! ! ! ! !
__label__love __label__joy	we 've deployed 's plot pack in both activex and . net flavors with great success . great api , incredibly flexible , provides a toolbar that let s users pan / zoom / customize . it 's solid , has a long track record , relatively inexpensive , and is very fast .

__label__fear	i 'm writing an eclipse plugin for the jdt. i need a functionality that tracks certain strings or regular expressions and possibly creates markers . i know that eclipse already does that for // todo comments , for example ( creating task markers for them ) but i 'm not sure if i can use the same mechanism . i can write my own but worried it would be too inefficient and not sensitive enough to code chnanges .
__label__anger	we use hessian in our software , and i wish the previous developers did n't do this as we now have to access the hessian endpoint from c ++ . it 's a pain and i prefer things to be in simple http xml or json .
__label__love	you already have a great answer , but i wanted to give you a resource so you do n't actually have to install ie8 . you can use this site to test ie6- , ff2- , chrome - , safari - , and opera - . it 's a really excellent tool !
__label__anger	anyone have a graphical tool for developing mod_rewrite rules . ideally it would display a pipeline of rewrites and then when given an instance of a uri would show the transforms as the get applied . it 's always a pain to get them setup just right so any way of making it easier would help .
__label__anger	is this seriously the only way to modify the default template ? this seems absolutely terrible .
__label__anger	ok this is really annoying , ca n't find a solution that works !

__label__anger	i 've searched this and can not find it . i 've tried different plugins and different browsers ( firefox , opera , and chrome ) . i 've tried most of the no flash plugins for each of those as well as disabling flash plugins / addons in the settings . i also renamed the file in i found by searching the system . when i renamed it , makes firefox and chrome ask to install flash , but still : returns : i 'm not sure what else to try without uninstalling flash , but that will be a total pain in the ass for this . i also really do n't want to use swfobject just to see if flash is at all installed which i can do simply with : any ideas ?
__label__anger	@ravenspoint : if you want to create the object on the heap now and delete it after execution in an other thread , i should probably remind you of raii - > very bad programming style ! ! ! or do you want to make some silly synchronisation to ensure the data is still valid , when being read by the new thread ?
__label__anger	i 'll second the ni measurement studio . i 've plotted points / sec with ni measurement studio 's chart control . also , this test was done on a laptop with a very lousy video card . afaik , measurement studio is using opengl internally .
__label__anger	i do n't understand this part : one thing i 've found with this is that passing the config around to all the other utility functions that i 'd prefer and do n't think should be a a part of one the the above mentioned classes can seem to get incredibly tedious . anyway , look up on thread - local storage . you could make a singleton config object that is thread - local .

__label__love	great thanks ! serverfault . com - the new server admin equivalent of stackoverflow !

__label__fear	one of my tables in my sql database has a growth rate of two nibbles per nanosecond . i was wondering how many megabytes per day that is and should i be worried ? my hard disk is gb.
__label__anger	you are processing the newline character as if it is legitimate input . you should either read the entire line ( including the newline , perhaps using a ) and then process the first character of the line or simply add a test to skip newlines in your loop logic.p.s . converting case by adding or subtracting is a really awful approach . it wo n't work with anything but a-z and a-z ( in the english alphabet ) . it wo n't work for most characters outside the basic latin block and should n't be used at all for characters that have no alternate case ( such as newline ) . you should be using and instead .
__label__love	how can i use the bliss view engine instead of the usual jade engine in express js. i already found one article here at stackoverflow , but this seems to be for the old version of express . js . i am using the .x version . in particular i would like to know how i can install bliss and following to this . how do i make a project in express . js , with a different view engine then jade ? currently i use this command in my project folder : thanks in advance !

__label__anger	this is n't really pythonic so much as tortured , but here 's a short version ( with meaningless - character variable names , no less ! )
__label__anger	compare these two methods : aside from the method signatures ( bar can declare instead of ) , is there any practical difference between the two methods ? to be clear : i 'm aware that this is a horrible approach to exception handling , and should not be done !
__label__love __label__joy	wow , great ! thanks , i did n't know this one existed .
__label__love	awesome ! thanks .
__label__love	i 'm absolutely staggered by the amazing response i 've received in the last minutes ! thankyou all so much for your answers . very , very helpful .
__label__joy	no worries , main thing is your problem gets solved !
__label__anger	that 's not a maintainable solution . most modern code metrics ( readability , simplicity , maintainability ) would conclude it 's a terrible solution .
__label__love	i would say yes , it was anders heljsberg 's intent to make the observer pattern a first - class language feature with events in c # , based on his experience with delphi . anders makes this and other design intentions clear in an excellent interview on .
__label__love	i am trying to make my javascript change when the window resizes , but can not seem to get it to work . the only difference i would like is for the offset ( ) .top to change from - to - as the window becomes smaller than 768px . this is what i have so far : any advice would be really great ! thank you

__label__anger	i am not familiar with python scripting . i am simply trying to create a small gui that will allow me to alter a parameter in an arcgis model using the tkinter scale and then run the model by clicking a tkinter button . ( the code below is not finished and is being used for testing purposes , hence the button does not actually call a different script yet ) . i get this typeerror in the traceback : i have tried deleting many different things from my code to determine what these arguments might be but to no avail . it is incredibly frustrating as i am sure it is the most simple problem . my code is as follows :
__label__anger	yes i 'm having the exact same issue , very annoying !
__label__surprise	something like this ? bonus . with the switch to you have readline editing capabilities , and tab completion on files . wooow !
__label__love	this will answer your question : good luck !
__label__anger	we have released a beta version of our software , and as we talked to people who started using it , we have found that a lot of the features ( which we thought were essential ) were not known and not used by the users . what are the possible ways to inform the application users about the features of the application ? i personally find the " tip of the day " popups extremely annoying and disable them quickly . are there better ways ?
__label__love	really great article , thanks !

__label__anger	i 'm trying to do this in a makefile and it fails horribly : do you know why ? i guess it has to do with escaping , but what and where ?
__label__love	just started testing as a crm solution for our company . someone asked for a google map on the page showing our upcoming engagements . i know zoho provides an api that allows accessing its data from the outside , but i actually need to integrate the map on the data - entry form . if anyone could provide a pointer to any mashup with zoho crm ( be it google maps , bing maps , or any similar web service ) , i would be extremely grateful .
__label__anger	that code is absolutely horrendous .
__label__joy	devexpress have a good one : the rangetrackbarcontrol control extends the functionality provided by the trackbarcontrol enabling end - users to select a range of values . two sliders can be used to set the minimum and maximum values : you can get them free from : hope this helps !

__label__anger	$ ( ' li:nth - child ( ) , li:nth - child ( ) ' ) .insertafter ( 'ul' ) .wrapall ( '' ) you ca n't " break a list " . you can either a ) remove it and replace it with two lists b ) extract some elements to make another list with . the following is terrible terrible practice , but then again so is what you 're asking ‚Ä¶

__label__anger	i have various files that i want to be ignored by svn when committing . i know that i can go into tortoisesvn and ignore them in various ways . i know that i can run svn propedit svn:ignore from the command line to do the same thing . the problem is that i have to have everyone on my team to do that , which is a pain . is there a way that i can put some file in a folder or set something in my svn repository that tells it to never check a certain file in ?
__label__anger	no , it is not possible -- we tried hard and ended up reverting to the way of using a custom class ‚Ä¶ check maattachedwindow well with enough swizzling and posing it 'd be possible of course ‚Ä¶ but that is very evil and at least as much work as your own class !
__label__love	excellent , all working now , thanks !

__label__anger	deleting files in xcode does not delete them from installed apps / build folders / etc. it 's extremely annoying . if you really want your app to only run in inch mode , delete the default- file and make sure to run clean / clean build folder in xcode , and delete the app completely off your simulator / device . it should start showing up letterboxed again . apple is still accepting in only submissions .

__label__anger	my guess would be from a colleague who wanted to scare this person out of ever using ' this ' again . it can be fairly annoying when someone uses ' this ' for every single thing they do . not that it justifies lying to a new programmer , but i can imagine someone doing this out of frustration .
__label__sadness	lambdas automatically ' suck ' in local variables , i 'm afraid that 's simply how they work by definition .

__label__anger	i have an existing javascript / flash - interaction kludge that sucks terribly . now i 've decided it 'd be better to write a flash app that does the specific thing without the need to interact with javascript . therefore i 'd need to produce flash apps in linux , and i do n't have money to throw at adobe right now ( perhaps never if their software keeps being terrible ) . also not going to do software development on windows , have been there , conclusion : that 's not going to work well ever . so , any solutions ? free or open source ?

__label__sadness	eruby is an external executable , while erb is a library within ruby . you would use the former if you wanted independent processing of your template files ( e.g. quick - and - dirty php replacement ) , and the latter if you needed to process them within the context of some other ruby script . it is more common to use erb simply because it is more flexible , but i 'll admit that i have been guilty of dabbling in eruby to execute files for quick little utility websites .

__label__anger	i really hate asking questions that i feel were asked a thousand times before . this is one of those questions i feel others must have encountered , , none of the supposed solutions work for me so i must be doing something wrong ‚Ä¶ i have an extremely simple app setup . index . htm , and terms . htm . there is some textual data in test . htm . i set both and at the appropriate time after stuff has loaded . at first i tried loading terms . htm ' s data into an element within index using ( both test and index are in the same root / assets / www / directory , and my webview loads index oncreate ) but absolutely nothing was happening . so i opted to try . ajax so that i could at least get an error message , and all i get is ' error ' . surely , it is possible to load local textual assets with jq on droidgap ?

__label__anger	i really hate jquery , your code looks as if you are looking forward to publishing your project finalized with jquery .. anyhow ‚Ä¶ if your looking to replace the jquery selector $ ( "" ) with a function you should know that the function requires that it returns a dom element . otherwise an error will be flagged and java script with abort .

__label__anger	herbert 's answer is a suggested way of marginally automating the browser to check the boxes and click the delete button . if one was to setup a browser automation project with selenium or such , then this would be a legitmate but painfully slow solution to delete all entities via the admin screen as it only deletes at most entities at a time .
__label__joy	agree that you should ensure that your data is properly indexed . apart from that , if you are worried about table size , you can always implement some type of data archival strategy to later down the line . do n't worry too much about this until you see problems cropping up , and do n't optimise prematurely .

__label__anger	obligatory i am not a lawyer . are you violating the legal clauses of the gpl ? probably not . ati and nvidia do this sort of thing with their graphics drivers for linux . however , it 's important to note that linux is gplv2 ; this may have changed with gplv3 . are you violating the spirit of the gpl ? yes , and judging from the way your question was written , you already knew this .

__label__love	@andrewlazarus - excellent point ! !
__label__love	how do you train neural network for pattern recognition ? for example a face recognition in a picture how would you define the output neurons ?

__label__love	excellent ! thanks very much . do n't understand why i did not try to find it myself . thanks again .
__label__anger	the question on how to check input for validity is answered numerous times ! you just check whether the stream is in a good state . if not , you 'll reset the stream and ignore the character . search for question where this answered . also , do n't use exceptions for non-exceptional cases and * always * throw something derived from ` std::exception ` : once you have tried to locate where an exception came from which is n't derived from ` std::exception ` in a program with a few million lines of code you 'll find it extremely helpful to look at what ` what ( ) ` returns !

__label__love	flexunit is pretty awesome - also asunit - they are both pretty similiar and both haven taken quite a bit from frameworks like junit . flexmonkey ( ) although i have n't used it myself seems to do ui unit testing .
__label__anger	i 'm working on a huge application and the extra steps you mentioned were really pain in the ass for me . so i developed a small proxy class that handles class method bindings . first i 've added a small proxy class then added a category accessor to nsapplication ( i actually added this to my application delegate and implemented ) now you are ready to bind class methods to the application object , even in the interface builder , with the keypath .
__label__anger	this is horrible . first you 're sleeping , which will never wait exactly the right amount of time . it may fail if the computer is busy and shutdown takes longer than expected . and otherwise it will waste time . furthermore , you 're using shared * persistent * state . the right solution is simply to free the ` runonce ` mutex before calling ` application . restart ( ) ` .
__label__sadness	when specified as above , spring distinguishes constructor arguments by order of appearance . the notation would only switch between setting the attributes by constructor to setting them by accessor . i 'm afraid , this will not change anything .

__label__joy	ah , excellent ! üôÇ
__label__anger	what i want to know is , what does create ? what can i do with it ? what does it mean ? every tutorial without fail will avoid talking about the first version entirely the reason the tutorial does n't rell you what to do with it is that it really is totally useless ! it allocates a single and gives you a pointer to that . the problem is that if you want an int , why do n't you just declare one ?
__label__joy __label__surprise	this is really weird . but a great question you posted ! nice to read . here could be a solution : http://stackoverflow.com/a/ /1320237why would it be impossible to import the calltips module from the standart library ? maybe you have a python idle open ? then they interfere ?
__label__surprise	wow ! i always thought double quotes were required !

__label__anger	just let ie6 flicker . i do n't think it 's worth it to invest time in a dying browser when your base functionality works well enough . if you 're worried about flickering for accessibility reasons , just sniff for ie6 and replace the animation with a generic show ( ) and hide ( ) instead . i recommend avoiding complicated code for edge cases that do n't matter .

__label__anger	i absolutely hate how tabs work in xcode . however , the only workaround i found that works decent is using the osx tabs shortcuts : ctrl + cmd + - > ctrl + cmd + < -
__label__love	first : i like your approach of being concentrated on a clean and proper state handling of your application . excellent ! but , as you said : android can kill activities and manage their lifecycle for itself . the os may release memory allocated for your activity as soon as possible requiring you to allocate it again . this means your fragment may or may not get destroyed . as you can see in your stack trace , fragmentactivity . oncreate is called . this obviously inddicates your existing resources created within the context of the old activity are not access - able anymore . the only context that is guaranted to exist through your application lifecycle is the application context . for all other resources you should be aware and handle properly that created resources may be invalid at the time you are trying to access them .

__label__joy	would you happen to have another column in your table where you can group them as " " , " " , etc ? it would look something like this: st column | second columna | 1b | 1c | d | 1a | 2b | 2c | d | 2if you order it by 2nd column , it will return . but since you have another column , you can do order by st column , 2nd column , and it will be .this ia ofcourse assuming that you have a field like st column . but given that you 're looking at having them order like , there must be something in your other fields that can help you achieved that hope this helps !

__label__love	you made an excellent point in a comment below , @railsson : you want to print √¢¬£s to display a specific currency , but employ that display using a japanese expression for financial numbers . i find it strange that your request has n't been implemented in the language by decoupling the ` locale ` module 's use of currency value and that currency 's display properties .

__label__love	is a really great option for git . most of the free , public hosting sights will insist that you license your code with an oss license ( and , possibly , your documentation ) . that 's potentially a different thing that you 're talking about ( backups ) . for just backups , you may want to try a for - pay service or even something like .

__label__anger	if you 're debugging at the instruction level rather than the source level , it 's an awful lot for you easier to map unoptimized instructions back to the source . also , compilers are occasionally buggy in their optimizers . in the windows division at microsoft , all release binaries are built with debugging symbols and full optimizations . the symbols are stored in separate pdb files and do not affect the performance of the code . they do n't ship with the product , but most of them are available at the .

__label__joy __label__anger	i discovered the problem : i created my rails project with and had a model ' dream ' as well . rails was looking at the application class instead of the model class . i got an error about dream already existing when i created the model and hand hacked my way around that ( in retrospect , a horrible idea ) . this has been very frustrating but i have learned quite a bit !
__label__joy	excellent , i 'm glad that worked for you !
__label__love	that 's terrific , thank you !
__label__anger	i was getting the same error when i tried to submit a version update from the organizer . what solved my issue was using the application loader found in the directory / developer / applications / utilities . you 'll need to compress your . app file and send the corresponding . zip file . i used this for my initial submission as well , i just thought i 'd try the new way . what a pain ! go with application loader .

__label__anger	i have a custom uitableviewcontroller class that is shared among a few viewcontrollers of my app . i would like to do pre-emptive fetching before the user has hit the bottom of the page . however , i noticed that if the user scrolls up and then down again , my vc will trigger another fetching . so i came up with a flag isfetching which checks to prevent double fetching . unfortunately i am running asynchronous code and i need a way to reset this flag after my fetching operation has completed . feedvc : delegate : i find it very painful to pass around a finish bloc in order to flip a boolean . does anyone have a better recommendation ?

__label__anger	i had the same problem and ended up doing the same workaround . when i was done i did n't really hate it though , because it allowed me to free - up the uipageviewcontroller and all of it 's child uipageviewcontrollers and all of their resources when the user was n't actively using the tab .
__label__love	i have a . dll file and the . lib file for it . the dll talks to an electronic key reader , and allows you to read / write the key id . this is the only documentation that comes with : i have never used dll before and really have no idea how i am supposed to use it in a c program . i really have no idea what do past this : if someone could show me an example how how to get devicepresent and how to use writekeyid i would be very greatful !

__label__anger	this will compile a regular expression that matches one or more this opens the file located at for reading , assigning the subsequent file object to the variable the function of file objects returns a list of the lines of the object . it is exactly identical to on systems that use as a newline . ( windows typically uses ) this splits the first element of ( ) including everything but the last element ( ) on the regex you defined earlier ( that , again , catches all - > ) note that this is really awful code . there 's no reason to use a regex here , and using when you 're only looking for the first line is kind of like building an engine so you know what the spark plugs look like . this is better :
__label__love	i really liked which c ++ however you can easily translate that to c # the author has a web site too .

__label__joy	is there a shorthand for a new line character in scala ? in java ( on windows ) i usually just use " \ n " , but that does n't seem to work in scala - specifically outputs in eclipse , ( sic ) from the command line , and from the repl ( great success ! ) works , but is there anything shorter ?
__label__anger	this is a problem with windows firewall that is very annoying from its introduction . and persist trough several versions of windows . i have two questions : is it possible to be disabled or at least require confirmation in xp / server ? does uac handles this in vista / server ? if it does not - is there any way to disable it ?

__label__anger	i want to duplicate a very large table , but i do not want to copy it row by row . is there a way to duplicate it ? for example , you can truncate w/o deleting row / row , so i was wondering if there is something similar for copying entire tables update : row by row insert is very painful ( because of m rows ) . anyway to avoid that ?

__label__anger	yup , wcf is a world of config pain , stick to asmx
__label__anger	this is how you find the arc length given the parameter , but finding equidistant points requires the inverse of this function . getting from one to the other is not trivial . @christian romo : how did you do it ? i mean , you can just use binary search , but that would be horribly slow ( for what i 'm trying to do , anyway ) .
__label__joy __label__sadness	sorry , i misread your question and thought that the dragged row was the one that was shrinking . it 's hard to say what is going on without seeing all your code . is it possible that you do n't have the columns styled to a fixed size and they are shrinking because you are dragging the widest content out of them ? if you could set up a small duplication at [ jsfiddle ] ( http://jsfiddle.net ) it would be helpful .
