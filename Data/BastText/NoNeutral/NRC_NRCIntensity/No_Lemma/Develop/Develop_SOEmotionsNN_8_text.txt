__label__anger	my nslog messages no longer show up in my debug area . anyone have an idea how the could have happened ? i can hit command- to bring of a list of logs in the left pane , select the latest one and view it in my editor window , but it is extremely annoying compared to having the console output in the debug area .
__label__anger	managing url paths can be a real pain in asp . net . absolutepath vs relativepath vs etc. drives me crazy . i find that many solutions require the user to edit web . config element to include the correct subfolder path ; ex . website root : web . config setting : / website root : web . config setting : / blog / is there a way to properly handle this without having to make changes to the web . config ?
__label__anger	☹️ this is a well - known css bug in ie6 . afaik the workaround ( it 's horrible , shield your eyes ) is to put an iframe underneath your menu so that the iframe obscures the improperly z - indexed select . it 's so very horrible . but jquery is here to the rescue , as always :
__label__anger	when i refactor the following line : using resharper 's " use object initializer " , i get the following : i really hate this type of formatting because with longer object names and variables it just gets out of control . how can i get resharper to do the following ?

__label__anger	how to set the default proxy for internet explorer in c # . net ? i wan na make a browser capable of searching for a valid proxy in a . txt file and using it . the ip and port used with the set default proxy command are valid however , the command itself does absolutely nothing . the only way i 've found to use a proxy with a vs2013 . net browser is by adding it manually to ie which is incredibly useless .
__label__anger	okay i am using the same antlrworks and jdk .. but it does n't work for me ☹️ .. its very irritating , i have tried everything to make it work !
__label__anger	i hate being that guy , but this is really not the way to do whatever you aretrying to do
__label__anger	its a pain in the neck
__label__anger	well , this is a bit of an awful hack but quite frankly any c ++ application which needs a way to define an unconstructable object is probably already an awful hack ! and under gcc , i get the following : test . cpp : in function â€˜int main ( ) â€™ : test . cpp : : error : can not declare variable â€˜an_instanceâ€™ to be of abstract type â€˜laâ€™ test . cpp : : note : because the following virtual functions are pure within â€˜laâ€™ : test . cpp : : note : virtual void la::oh_no_you_dont ( )
__label__anger	working with anes is an incredibly frustrating process .
__label__anger	hate to have to do this , but it works !
__label__anger	note that this does n't use a stringbuilder , so will have horrible performance for very long sequences .
__label__anger	i had figured out the solution . what i realized was happening was that the deployments stopped working period , not just certain files were not coming across . this is absolutely a bug in azure deployment as near as i can figure . i had to drop & recreate my site in the cloud and the deployment continued to work . as a side rant . microsoft makes it extremely painful for someone to submit a bug as compared to other software vendors . and they wonder why their market share is shrinking .
__label__anger	probably has something to do with the unbearable bugginess of the telerik radcontrols suite
__label__anger	clicking the zoom ( or pan ) button again , restores it . terribly silly - yes !
__label__anger	i am currently having some difficulties trying converting a unicode character string ( dt_wstr ) into an int this is what i have ( note most writings are in german , but i think someone who has worked with ssis will unterstand anyways ) data type selected : a four - byte , unsigned integer . but all it does is fail terribly
__label__anger	i personally only use the ' m ' and the ' p ' . the rest is just zany in my view . it makes the code so darn hard to decipher . i did maintenance work on this guy 's code who used semi-hungarian notation type id prefixes on every variable , function , and other identifier in the code . he used $ signs liberally to separate words . it was hard to keep the murderous rage in check .
__label__anger	it is really painfull to get all code form tfs whenever you make a build using nant . is there any settings in ccnet . config which will only take the files which are changed form last time which can speed up the process .
__label__anger	i got very angry with oracle today after reading lots of editable tableview solutions involving setoneditcommit , which is just not the right way it should be done . following is a much better and simpler solution i found after digging the javafx source :
__label__anger	horrible but linqy !
__label__anger	also be aware that as a programming language tex is most awful , the worst language in real use i 've come across .
__label__anger	i 've changed the color scheme on sublime text and i really hate the colors it changed to . so what is the name of the default settings ? because i want to change it back to the standard .

__label__anger	this was one area of c that the designers got terribly badly wrong !
__label__anger	the other issue the number of variations in everyone 's sip implementation . solving all of the integration issues would quickly eat up all your time . at $ for ocs that just does n't make much sense .
__label__anger	i am new to delphi ( been programming in it for about months now ) . so far , it 's been an extremely frustrating experience , most of it coming from how bad delphi is at handling dates and times . maybe i think it 's bad because i do n't know how to use tdate and ttime properly , i do n't know . here is what is happening on me right now : that 's not the exact code i use , everything is in variables and used in another context , but i think you can see the problem . why is that calculation wrong ? how am i suppose to work around this problem ?
__label__anger	hmm….vs is telling me this is already a string ? guess it 's lying !
__label__anger	it 's not possible to open the page in full screen without user interaction ( clicking on a button etc. ) because it would be extremely annoying .
__label__anger	what exactly is not working ? itâ€™s hard to guess â€¦ you shouldnâ€™t be using erigi to check for a substring : ) itâ€™s deprecated ) use instead . edit : your code screams sql injection !
__label__anger	i found this great node mysql boilerplate : it works terrific ! however , now i need to hook it in to my existing user table , and my key field is named userid , not simply id , and changing the key fieldname in mysql breaks the example . so my question is , where in the project do i need to specify a different id field name ? i see user . id in / util / auth . js passport . serializeuser and id in passport . deserializeuser functions , but it seems it must be specified elsewhere too . i 'm hoping this is a simple question for users of passportjs !
__label__anger	what is the difference between and similarly and it is really painful when i align the controls with and when i try to align in the design mode it adds the , how to prevent auto adding property to a control while aligning it , as i already defined the to it why it does n't update the same property . its really irritating when we want to do animation on controls , it reverses the direction of animation
__label__anger	anyone ? ? ? i 'm starting to hate vs for that reason !
__label__anger	this is one of the shortcomings of dgv that i absolutely hate and why i almost always bind to an ienumerable of an anonymous type .
__label__anger	i 've been having this issue for some time and kept just disabling the " script " tab which is really annoying ! i tried to click the pause button so it 's flashing and refresh , same issue . then , click so it 's not flashing and refresh , same issue . i just now clicked the pause button ( so it was blinking ) , then un-clicked it so it was not blinking , and then refreshed the page and it seems to have fixed it . the same page that was breaking on a script error is no longer breaking on the error .
__label__anger	everytime i execute my app in debug mode , the execution breaks inside some class file of an external library that i 'm using . even though it 's a nullpointerexception , for some reason i can hit resume and continue the execution . in case you 're curious , i 've put the stacktrace below . my problem though is that i simply want to stop that . it 's extremely annoying and happens every now and then during the execution . but i ca n't find any setting anywhere which will prevent breaking inside class files . how do i avoid this ?
__label__anger	so , i 'm trying to make a d grapher for a class . right now i 'm working on understanding opengl and i 'm failing horribly . i want to move the camera , but i ca n't at all , whatsoever . why does n't this work ?
__label__anger	no ` . vimrc ` comes first ☹️ and i really hate to modify plugins …
__label__anger	i have to setup a rails project and rubygems . org is seemed to be down . that 's really horrible . ca n't believe it the whole ruby community have only one single not - so - reliable gems source . what should i do in such case ?

__label__anger	is there any way to quickly jump to a scene in a storyboard ? i have about different scenes / view controllers and it has become incredibly tedious to locate the view controller i 'm trying to edit .
__label__anger	i have a file in the form if i try to splot such file , gnuplot intended it as a surface , and the result is very awful ( because the endpoint of a line is close to the endpoint of next line , not to the first point ) . how can i plot them as different lines ( as every line was in a different file ) ?
__label__anger	i abhor debugging a ` foreach ` loop . step in , step out . it 's so much easier to just debug a ` for ` loop ;
__label__anger	@carlnorum : that would be extremely annoying , given that the above is well - defined c89 …
__label__anger	this algorithm is terribly inefficient for small sample chosen from a large set . picking integers from a million takes one million calls to rand ( ) instead of .
__label__anger	android camera stuff is extremely frustrating , i understand that . make sure to read through all of the and check out this code below referenced from :
__label__anger	$ ( ' li:nth - child ( ) , li:nth - child ( ) ' ) .insertafter ( 'ul' ) .wrapall ( '' ) you ca n't " break a list " . you can either a ) remove it and replace it with two lists b ) extract some elements to make another list with . the following is terrible terrible practice , but then again so is what you 're asking …
__label__anger	you could implement it using ` goto` 's ( the horror ! )
__label__anger	link is down again .
__label__anger	that 's not a " jquery onchange " , it 's a " horrible inline onchange " !
__label__anger	whenever i drag - n - drop a stored procedure onto my context canvas , the parameters / arguments for the stored procedure are all nullable . why is this ? is it because of how i 've declared my parameters inside the stored procudure itself ? besides manually creating my stored procedure methods in the context partial class ( or drag - n - drop onto canvas , cut from autogen 'd code , move to partial class , then remove nullables types ) .. is there any way to fix this ? it 's really frustrating ☹️
__label__anger	i have a web page that renders the same in ie7 , firefox , and safari - except when printing . ie7 appears to allocate too much space for borders when printing . in the example below , the box heights plus borders should add up to the same height in the columns . i set the borders to 10px to exaggerate the problem . i hate css hacks , and so far i 've been able to create my pages without them . any suggestions ?
__label__anger	what a strange website candyundies . com sounds disgusting !
__label__anger	terrible approach , xml stores data , not formats !
__label__anger	no . i can not seem to be getting the module to work . its really pain staking .
__label__anger	the following ( cut down ) code excerpt is a linq - to - entities query that results in sql ( via totracestring ) that is much slower than a hand crafted query . am i doing anything stupid , or is linq - to - entities just bad at optimizing queries ? i have a tolist ( ) at the end of the query as i need to execute it before using it to build an xml data structure ( which was a whole other pain ) . while working on this , i 've also has some real problems with dates . when i just tried to include returned dates in my data structure , i got internal error " " .
__label__anger	yeah , it 's definitely annoying !
__label__anger	i absolutely hate that this exists , but there it is :
__label__anger	ff @ fault ? damn … hate when my buddy fails me .
__label__anger	that 's not a maintainable solution . most modern code metrics ( readability , simplicity , maintainability ) would conclude it 's a terrible solution .
__label__anger	i ca n't get to work a many - to - many relationship using bookshelf . js . models : database table " events " : database table " tags " : database table " events_tags " : query that is n't returning what it should : the log outputs : that is : empty array of tags , which is wrong . question : is there an issue with my code ? the desired output should be : this does n't help in the question , but i 'll throw it anyway : i 'm currently hating all orms in node js ! maybe i should just use a query builder .
__label__anger	i worked on a desktop app that used ejb and hibernate . we had to set everywhere , because when the objects get serialized , they lose their ability to be fetched from the backend . that 's just how it goes , unfortunately . if you are concerned with performance , you could use caching on the backend so that your non-lazy fetches are not as painful .
__label__anger	this is an absolutely horrid wart in the api , but it 's never going away .
__label__anger	i also fail to get webgl to work on mac osx . really frustrating ! osx mac book pro
__label__anger	as title , basically i have a user control placed inside a page and then the page is placed inside the master page . i want to extract a block of javascript and put it back to the page head . when i try to wrap the code inside any block control ( e.g. a div runat server ) and access divid . innertext then asp . net bust off with i do nt want to extract js inside cs file , that s awfully ugly approach ( all sort of escapes and people wo nt even notice you have js written unless they drill your cs file ) , what can i do ?
__label__anger	you can look at openoffice base . i tried it out awhile back when it first came out and it seemed awfully slow and it did n't seem feature complete either . but it is free and open source 😮 )
__label__anger	after installing a lot of apps , and building a few myself , i 'm sure many people have been wondering about this . if i 'm looking through my sd card it looks absolutely horrible , and its really hard to find folders that are mine for putting music / videos / pictures in between all the folders for different applications . is there any conventions here that we , the developers , should try to put their apps into one base folder or has google forgot about this completely ?

__label__joy	i have no clue if this approach would be feasible or not , but then there are two things you could try : .create a singleton class where you and the arraylist . the class might look like this : to access the list you could write : is the name of the getter method and before getting it set it . else you might get . also a receiver might start before the list is filled . so always check for null before you use it. .the other option is you store the list in a cache object like check for even in this case in the broadcast receiver before using it . hope that helps !
__label__joy	you can try the ( very ) comprehensive jeff 's or go with this simple workaround : and then declare the attribute as an integer : this worked very fine for me ! 😃
__label__joy	it 's not a homework , and since there is nowhere on the internet how to solve this , i came up here . @pmr excellent proposal ! 🙂

__label__joy	hopefully this will provide some ideas as to how to adapt a timer based approach for your needs : if your needs are more sophisticated then a tthread based approach may be more appropriate . but whatever you do , do not resort to application . processmessages it will only cause you grief !

__label__joy	hi there , i was able to set the focus back on the selected item after some research on similar issue . all i needed to do was , call the begininvoke method on the dispatcher property of the listbox and do the focus setting on the selecteditem in the listbox in the delegate method call which is as below : box.dispatcher.begininvoke ( dispatcherpriority.system.idle , new focus ( setfocus ) , box ) ; where focus is the delegate and setfocus is the delegate method where i get the selected item from the listbox and set focus on the corresponding listboxitem . hope this helps ! ! regards , sowmi
__label__joy	if you only need the count ( like you express in your original question ) , you could do : hope it helps !
__label__joy	excellent ! did you know that you can answer your own question and accept it as ** the ** answer . this is considered a good practice , because it helps people looking for answers see that there is an answer and it helps them find the answer . if the answer is only in comments , the question will appear unanswered .
__label__joy	have a look at . i 've tried to get my " msn invite contacts " function working right now and that 's what i 've found this far . works excellent !

__label__joy	i have a long scrolling page , and want to test if an element is 100px from the top , then apply a class elsewhere ( until the next element in line is 100px from the top ) if i could just get the basic statement i would be ecstatic , anything extra would be a bonus !
__label__joy	yes , you need two view controllers . check out lesson from stanfords cs193p iphone application programming course . it is available online . both slides and the lecture through itunes u. i really enjoyed watching the course !
__label__joy	i have exactly the same issue and am extremely interested in whether you found any solution .
__label__joy	you could go with for free , or something like ( which is excellent ) if you are willing to pay . i hope i 've understood your question .

__label__sadness	i have two loops running in my code , i want to use an element from an array as the key in a second array , but am unsure how to do this with smarty . "" contains an integer ( pulled from the db ) i want to use that value as the key in a second loop , which runs fine if i harcode in the integer : pseudo code for the sort of thing i 've been trying is : but of course , this does n't work ! can anybody help ?
__label__sadness	well … taht 's … sad ☹️
__label__sadness	this should do it ( it 's not quite a one - liner i 'm afraid ) :
__label__sadness	i 'm apologize for saying this , but the code you 've posted is simply awful and needs desperate refactoring . create a class to represent properties instead of parallel arraylists , and use string . split to parse a comma - seperated list .
__label__sadness	that made me cry 😭
__label__sadness	http://stackoverflow.com/a/ / . sad ☹️
__label__sadness	i have developed a cumulative sum function as defined below in the haskell library repa . however , i have run into an issue when combining this function with the transpose operation . all of the following operations take well under a second : however , if i write : performance degrades horrendously . while each individual operation in isolation takes well under a second on a 1920x1080 image , when combined they now take + seconds … any ideas on what could be causing this ? my gut tells me it has something to do with delayed arrays , not forcing at the right time , etc … but i do not have enough experience to track this down quite yet .
__label__sadness	very sad , no way … (

__label__love __label__joy	by creating datastore models that inherit from the expando class i can make my model - entities / instances have dynamic properties . that is great ! but what i want is the names of these dynamic properties to be determined at runtime . is that possible ? for example , is this possible ? if yes , how to do this ? i have already tried some funny ways to do this but did not succeed 😛 thanks in advance .
__label__love __label__joy	upvote for both the answer and the comments . priceless 🙂
__label__love __label__joy	other 's have posted equally viable options , so really pick the one that makes the code prettiest to you ! 🙂
