__label__sadness	hi lars , sorry about the delay in respond . good point about the treemap always return result in a deterministic ordering . the patch itself i think be still beneficial because it remove a little bit of redundancy in the exist equality code . imo , the fix make it easy to understand as well . in addition , the test be beneficial since we be miss coverage there . i think it would be good if the fix be in soon , but it 's probably not an issue if we move it to .

__label__love	thanks a ton for your review , todd . here 's an update patch which address all of your comment except the follow . bq. in editlogfileinputstream , why do we need to pass isinprogress as a boolean ? if it 's in-progress , that mean we do not know the lasttxid , so it would be invalid_txid , right ? so we can implement isinprogress ( ) by just compare lasttxid . because in the case of pre-transactional elfis , we pass in invalid_txid , even though the log be not yet in progress . i be still work on produce an update patch which also add testing for the pending dn message queue .

__label__love	bq. though , pig itself compile fine and be ready to go , the contrib project ( owl , zebra , piggybank / hiverc ) do nt compile , i think because either it do not download dependices of those project or do not include them in the build path . ashutosh , yes . i do realize it and as you rightly guess , it be because the ivy - dependency list do not have some jar that be actually be use by contrib package . this be not an issue relate to eclipse - classpath . however , there have to be a jira open to solve this issue of download the miss jar by ivy . can you please file a jira for this ? thanks

__label__love	thanks alex . it look like a good path to solve this issue .
__label__anger __label__sadness	this be pretty embarassing !
__label__surprise	thirdly , the scenario you present in which someone copy a subset of their schema would only error if that person also choose to omit the defaultsearchfield declaration -- but why would they do that ?
__label__surprise	what be convenient for the user to download #crd# archive to run the project ( or install maven ) ?
__label__love __label__sadness	i be sorry for the delay in respond . if you think the new patch be read for commit can you check patch available and it will get back on the radar . be derbyall clean as well l ? i be not see the original path anymore . for future reference , i think it be good in general to keep the old #crd# there to see what 's change . thank you so much for all your work on derby !
__label__joy	> - fouseragent . getstream ( ) be cool and very easy to use ( now that it 's properly > document ) .
__label__joy	xueqiang , i just commit your late patch . keep up the good work ! #hlink# ? rev = & view = rev
__label__joy	look like this be fix ðŸ™‚
__label__joy	tim , the fix be good . please close this jira . thanks a lot .
__label__joy	ok cool , this be just a matter of add string to the various [ notfound ( ) | #hlink# return in file . cpp there be a number of error case in the [ browse | #hlink# and [ read | #hlink# endpoint , i would imagine #crd# could change the javascript to generate bad request which should be sufficient to test this ðŸ™‚
__label__joy	bq. ok w / the late patch all test pass for me ! great awesome ! ðŸ™‚
