__label__love	vishal kher to benjamin , camille : am ( minutes ago ) hi ben , i was going to open a jira after checking with you guys . with your solution wo n't we run in into the problem that camille pointed out by marking the snapshot for lastzxid - ? - peer fails after taking the snapshot . the snapshot has applied lastzxid , which created a child znode . during recovery it will apply lastzxid , which will faill with nodeexists and we will increment the cversion of the parent ( after fix for zookeeper- ) . so creation of sequential znodes wo n't be be really sequential . this is probably acceptable , but should be clearly documented . if not , then from this bug , it looks to me that patch zookeeper- was also not complete . we may need to conditionally update cversion . i think we need a clear document of how snapshots are supposed to work and what to assume while taking snapshots and while recovering from snapshots . it will be very helpful for to verify the correctness of implementation and for future bug fixes.i will open a jira for this bug shortly and post our discussion as well . thanks . - vishal

__label__sadness	i 'm very busy for the moment so i did n't know when i ' d be able to the change myself , so if you can , your contribution would be one more time really appreciated .
__label__sadness	thanks so much , sorry that this is n't in the appropriate place .
__label__sadness	if someone wants to work on this please go ahead , i still plan to , just no time yet .
__label__sadness	i 'm sorry mark , i came back here to remove my comment as after building the app from scratch i have found that by default it used whenexhaustedaction = grow and not block !
__label__sadness	> then we do n't save io by limiting the buffer size to kb i 'm confused by this .
__label__sadness	sorry for the trouble vikram !
__label__sadness	first guess : something 's getting confused about reversed - ness .
__label__sadness	sorry â€¦
__label__sadness	sorry for the mistake .
__label__sadness	i do n't have strong opinions about it either way .
__label__sadness	sorry about that â€¦ http://bit.ly/12uias
__label__sadness	sorry , that should be filechannel inputchannel = input . getchannel ( ) ; filechannel outputchannel = output . getchannel ( ) ; in the try block .
__label__sadness	well it 's me that did n't get the whole point , now i got more , sorry for the noise .
__label__sadness	wrong patch , sorry .
__label__sadness	sorry , i have n't tried you patch .
__label__sadness	seems we did n't enforce an exec for sh , but we did for fs.
__label__sadness	sorry , i missed bill 's comment . bq. we 've seen similar exceptions when loading data that contains text with the column delimiter in it , which produces shorter than expected tuples . could that be the case here ? i do n't think that 's the case here . however , i 've made many silly mistakes&misunderstandings in pig before . let me double check .
__label__sadness	sorry gav done committed @revision .
__label__sadness	sorry guys , i 've been pretty busy @ work but i have been watching this .
__label__sadness	rmappattemptimpl . recoverappattempttokens ( ) looks like all changes in rmappimpl are unnecessary .
__label__sadness	hey , sorry i did not get back to you sooner .
__label__sadness	i did not have time to do it yesterday .
__label__sadness	i have this issue , where my server and client is creating a lot of loopback threads , that i believe must be related to this issue .
__label__sadness	hi lars . sorry , i was n't watching this before so i missed your work til you mentioned it on the hbase jira . i 'll try to take a look at this this week . feel free to grab me on irc if you have specific questions .
__label__sadness	sorry , this should be yarn jira - filed yarn- instead
__label__sadness	sorry chris , i missed it , done !
__label__sadness	and with a network that tolerates almost everything to get a mail somehow in the right place , it is only seldom noticed ( or when it is , it is blamed on microsoft .
__label__sadness	i have a really bad habit of not reading thru all the bug comments before asking questions .
__label__sadness	oh , sorry , will submit them tomorrow . hmm , svn diff is really strange . do n't know why the files were not included though i did the diff from the src / java / o / a / c / jci dir .
__label__sadness	sorry for the noise .
__label__sadness	patch is not well formed , cancel patch . sorry about this .
__label__sadness	i am new to mina and the whole environment .
__label__sadness	sorry .
__label__sadness	sorry about that .
__label__sadness	incidentally if we all nag joe walnes enough we might be able to persuade him to release a new qdox which can ignore annotations etc ( though it will still struggle with generics i think )
__label__love __label__sadness	thanks , willem . sorry , i was trying to get to the wiki but it 's been a busy week .
__label__surprise	woops ; thought this was already fixed â€¦
__label__surprise	thanks for reviewing the patch mamta !
__label__anger	aaarrggh , how stupid of mine to have a system . out , again !
__label__anger	i do n't have to ensure that the classloader knows groovy classes , * you * must do that .
__label__anger	bug flavio more ? seriously ; discuss with flavio and come up with a patch & test that is deterministic . another option would be to refactor to allow the code in question to be tested as a true unit test ; rather than as a system test ( we need to work on that in general in zk ) . mockito ?
__label__anger	damn â€¦
__label__anger	i lost the whole morning cause hbase 's regionserver was dying with no logs , no nothing â€¦ how am i supposed to debug the issue if u do not even generate a core dump ?
__label__anger	pull it back in if you think different .
__label__anger	inserting timestamps automagically would be bad because it would limit a whole swath of use cases .
__label__anger	the rest are * totally * unrelated .
__label__anger	damn time has flown â€¦
__label__anger	this is weird .
__label__anger	my bad .
__label__anger	i 'm an idiot â€¦ there 's nothing wrong with the readme . txt .
__label__anger	ugh , well that sucks .
__label__anger	oh ... geez i 'm an idiot .
__label__anger	i used to be the latter , but then i went to law school and got a degree in this shit .
__label__anger	splitting an existing sub-shard gets stuck up .
__label__anger	i should have marked this resolved back in september .
__label__anger	must be : size > = !
__label__anger	hmm , that sucks .
__label__anger	i just hate having no clue what a file is really depending on ðŸ˜‰
__label__anger	damn it !
__label__anger	when you install a node module globally it goes into / usr / local where you do n't have permissions to move shit into unless you sudo .
__label__anger	it 's not too bad once cacheconfig is in.
__label__anger	damn it , sry lost the orientation .
__label__anger	i do n't think there is any sense in this , who cares ?
__label__anger	damn this was assigned to you since months .
__label__anger	weird .
