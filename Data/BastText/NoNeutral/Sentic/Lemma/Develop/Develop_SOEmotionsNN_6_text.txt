__label__surprise	oh , yea , do not notice , answer below this #crd# be at most half a year old .
__label__surprise	project ! wow ! well i can see that happen for what you do ‚Ä¶
__label__fear	after instal node , fresh installation of yeoman throw several warning . command warning i be not sure , whether i should be worried about these warning or just ignore them ! either way i want to understand the reason behind get these warning .
__label__fear	i be afraid you can not fetch that ! the graph api do not provide any api to do so .
__label__fear	exactly why i be ask because that s what i fear !
__label__fear	` logger logger = new logger . getlogger ` - i would be more worried about the impending logpocalypse !
__label__fear	oh , i be scared !
__label__fear	out of all that pseudocode , the only thing that really worry me be " extract code sample from file " . read file from a directory be trivial , save a file be trivial . regardless of the test framework i would spend most of my time focus on the parsing bit . for direct testing , i would embed the snippet directly into the test case : ah , i see another change i subtly make while write the test : my examplestocode . parse ( ) return an array ( or other iterable container ) , so that it can be test apart from the iteration itself .
__label__fear	a colleague recently ask me how to deep - clone a map and i realize that i probably have never use the clone ( ) method - which worry me . what be the most common scenario you have find where you need to clone an object ?
__label__anger __label__sadness	i have a serious problem which i can not a solution to . i need to authenticate a token in order to let the user login into my app , the problem be that even though i be use the asynctask , and probably because of it , i can not authenticate it in time . other problem that sometimes accurs be that i get the networkonmainthreadexception error ‚Ä¶ i be really hopeless . here 's the flow - and here 's my code - that 's be the urldownloader class -
__label__sadness	it 's very painful to add multiple ticket to trac or to have it as your own todo list . that cause people to use their own task management tool so task be then spread all around . be there any plugin or macro that would quicken the process of add a ticket ?
__label__sadness	perhaps i be miss something , but i be just learn javascript . my understanding of single origin policy be that google analytics should not be able to send datum back to google . how be it able to transmit send datum to google without violate the policy ?
__label__sadness	i be sorry to say this but most silverlight grid do not support cell merging . at least not out of the box . i have resort to use component #crd# studio for silverlight in order to achieve this , and even then it have not be exactly a walk in the park . consider c0 data grid control . here be a sample on with sample code and a small write up . the down side of such solution be that c0's control be extremely expensive ‚òπÔ∏è i wish micro$oft come up with some enhancement in sl0 that would accommodate for such issue .
__label__sadness	* oh so very sad * ‚òπÔ∏è
__label__sadness	that 's depressing üòï be you sure i can not get a collection of all control on the page with a particular class and give them a single datum source ?
__label__sadness	that 's terrible ‚òπÔ∏è
__label__sadness	my guess be that you would have to extend the class for datatip , to check for null hitdata object , to kill / stop the drawing of the display . i do not think there be a way to do that normally in flex . you would have to customize and override the hitdata class unfortunately . what a pain ! !
__label__sadness	i be not for sure how the controlcollection of asp . net work , so maybe someone can shed some light on this for me . i recently discover the magic that be extension method and linq . well , i be very sad to find that this be not valid syntax however from what i can tell , do implement the interface which provide such method , so what give ? why do not that just work ? i have find a decent work around for this issue at least :
__label__sadness	if it 's form auth then yes , that 's weird . i be afraid i do not have any idea !
__label__sadness	its really sad ‚òπÔ∏è to hear " we can not fix footer or header view " .. it always get scroll with row .
__label__sadness	i have update the fiddle . i have to use class to get it to work , so its not % perfect imo .
__label__sadness	be pack - decimal part of the ebcdic format , or be this just a file which happen to use both ? i be not familiar with that format , i be afraid ‚òπÔ∏è
__label__sadness	right .. if only i be use sql server ‚Ä¶ informix unfortunately ‚òπÔ∏è ‚òπÔ∏è ‚òπÔ∏è
__label__sadness	i be afraid i can not really accept an answer here as it turn out that it can not really be do , without use a workaround , which i do not want to do . sorry !
__label__sadness	not sure this answer the question accurately , what do everyone else think ?
__label__sadness	that 's really sad ‚Ä¶
__label__love __label__anger	that 's the way i do it too . oracle 's create or replace be way good , i hate to repeat code .
__label__anger	in my android app i be try to share an open graph include an object and an action . in my facebook app i add a story : and ( be this ok ? ) . when i try to add an image to the object in the og i get above error . this be my code : here 's the logcat : what be i do wrong ? maybe i be mess up some string in the story , facebook tutorial be awful !
__label__anger	this be very strange , what be you try to do here . it look very scary code . where be your constructor ?
__label__anger	how come this be consider programming relate ?
__label__anger	i be work on a huge application and the extra step you mention be really pain in the ass for me . so i develop a small proxy class that handle class method binding . #ord# i have add a small proxy class then add a category accessor to nsapplication ( i actually add this to my application delegate and implement ) now you be ready to bind class method to the application object , even in the interface builder , with the keypath .
__label__anger	i really hate regex in principle . can it be do in a plane script or something ?
__label__anger	each tab in my xcode project can have navigation / debug / utility menu open . if i close those menu on #crd# tab , then switch to the next , they may be open . this be really frustrating ! if i want the menu close , i want them close on all tab . how can i change this behavior ?
__label__anger	its absurdly late / early so maybe i be just tired , but can anyone tell me why in the world the follow test be not fail ? really need a #ord# pair of eye to confirm i be not crazy‚Ä¶.now i be worried that all my test be unreliable .
__label__anger	be there any way to have a statement across multiple line without the underscore character ? it be really annoying in multi-line string such as sql statement , and especially linq query . beside from the ugliness and difficulty when change a line ( nothing line up anymore ) you can not use comment in the middle of the multi-line statement . example of my daily personal hell .
__label__anger	i have see this bug in resharper . it happen when the base class be in the app_code directory . do not know how to fix it , very annoying , code still compile though .
__label__anger	hi i be use the chrome inspector ( f0 ) to try and analyze the z - index of a twitter bootstrap popover , and find it extremely frustrating ‚Ä¶ be there a way to freeze the popover ( while show ) so that i can assess and modify the associate css ? place a fix ' hover ' on the associate link do not cause the popover to appear .
__label__anger	work - around ( horrible horrible invasive work - around ) i get around this by subclassing uiapplication to track all screen touch . by hold on to the last touch location , i can , in the delegate , map the location to the link to determine whether or not it should be consider valid : mycustomapplication.m ( use it in main.m ) and map it ‚Ä¶
__label__anger	be it possible to prevent a user from edit the title of a node on the node edit screen ? #crd# of the thing i really detest about drupal be the rigidity of the title & body field in each node .
__label__anger	this will compile a regular expression that match #crd# or more this open the file locate at for reading , assign the subsequent file object to the variable the function of file object return a list of the line of the object . it be exactly identical to on system that use as a newline . ( windows typically use ) this split the #ord# element of ( ) include everything but the last element ( ) on the regex you define early ( that , again , catch all - > ) note that this be really awful code . there 's no reason to use a regex here , and use when you be only look for the #ord# line be kind of like build an engine so you know what the spark plug look like . this be good :
__label__anger	actually it 's not as bad as it look - perl 's file::copy be horribly break ( for example it do not copy file permission on unix and other stuff ) , so many " high profile " hacker actually use system ( 'cp ' , $ target , $ destination ) or similar stuff
__label__anger	this be how you find the arc length give the parameter , but find equidistant point require the inverse of this function . get from #crd# to the other be not trivial . @christian romo : how do you do it ? i mean , you can just use binary search , but that would be horribly slow ( for what i be try to do , anyway ) .
__label__anger	when i slide to a next image , or when the slider / carousel automatically switch to the next image the previous image disapears too fast , which give it an extremely ugly look . i have make a video to make clear what i mean , can be check over here . anyone have an idea ? code for the carousel :
__label__anger	these will not jump : they be , however , soul destroy and extremely ugly .
__label__anger	i be work on a test application base on asp . net mvc. i be new to css stuff so i be learn that as well . i have create a master page call " new . master " and create a new css " new . css " . i be call the view from controller as : what i be do be that i be frequently update the css and master page . so i run the application in debug mode frequently . after sometime i stop see the effect of change in css. when i " view source " in chrome and check the css , it show an old version . when i change the name of both master page and css , i start to receive update view but that work for sometime and then again i stop get the css update . have you face this problem ? how can i fix it ? ( its terribly annoying ! )
__label__anger	alan , i assume some people already hate you just for ask . and they have a point .
__label__anger	i have a table that be reference by a ton of other table via foreign key . i be try to delete a document record , and accord to my execution plan , sql server be do a cluster index scan on every #crd# of the referencing table . this be very painful . i think have a fk automatically make an index on the fk field ? or be i wrong ? do i really have to go around my database put an explicit index on every single fk field ?
__label__anger	i hate dev - c ++ but because of a library , i have to use it ! ! ! what 's the matter for dev - c ++ or be there error in my code about use referance variable ? error : c:**\main.c syntax error before ' & ' token
__label__anger	maybe someone know how to disable content assist only on ' else ' keyword when work with php source editor in aptana ? as i really , really hate it with this keyword , because after new release it 's really mess with my workflow as after enter ' else ' and press enter it replace it with : and sometimes it decide to get rid of indent completely . mind you i do not want to disable content assist completely , i just want to disable it for ' else ' keyword .
__label__anger	i hate it none of the specify answer work for me ‚Ä¶
__label__anger	try to get s0 sdk work on linux be quite a pain . still struggle with that .
__label__anger	@wst it do not even have the decency to return the same map ? that be really terrible .
__label__anger	the error occur because be look in the wrong environment ( i.e. , not inside the data frame ) . you could explicitly specify the but that would be ugly , awful code . much good to use as iselzer suggest .
__label__anger	the follow code to use result in black image no capture , why ? note that add before capture have no effect ! googling have be completely useless for this case , so far !
__label__anger	i can not help think that make xml ad xmllist both unrelated , as in both extend object directly , be a design flaw in the as0 core library . surely have xml extend xmllist would be a much clean system , where xml be consider an xmllist with only #crd# member ? this would also avoid the very annoying practice of an e0x query possibly return either an xml or xmllist , which can result in a casting error . so be there any reason i be not think of that xml and xmllist be design to only have object as a common type ?
__label__anger	i find this code ( full version here ) it 's work for me but now i do not know how to stop it ( for make test it 's horrible , my new php file not interpret ! )
__label__anger	you be process the newline character as if it be legitimate input . you should either read the entire line ( include the newline , perhaps use a ) and then process the #ord# character of the line or simply add a test to skip newlines in your loop logic.p.s . convert case by add or subtract be a really awful approach . it wo not work with anything but a-z and a-z ( in the english alphabet ) . it wo not work for most character outside the basic latin block and should not be use at all for character that have no alternate case ( such as newline ) . you should be use and instead .
__label__anger	when query from the database use entity framework , what exception should #crd# catch and what should be do about them ? generally i use because i have no specific action or feedback for every possible type of error , but i be constantly remind that this be a terrible idea and that specific exception should be catch and handle ! example : what be the standard / guideline for handle ef exception ?
__label__anger	i have a bufferedwriter to which i use to write character into a pipedinputstream . base on keyboard event . but i be implement a backspace handler , but i can see no way of do so without unputc . i be almost fall back into use a string to buffer the current line . perhaps , i could do a good job use canvas instead . ( god how i hate java ! )
__label__anger	the problem be that " hello world " be a terrible example to use with tdd. you really need something that generate variable output base on variable input .
__label__anger	we have a - tier web application write in asp . net webforms where we will not be able to port it - recession really suck ! - to mvc. our goal be to implement a plugin architecture . #crd# way would be to use the app_code folder . be there any good alternative ?
__label__anger	this be extremely unsafe ! use ` mysqli ` or ` pdo ` instead of ` mysql _ ` .
__label__anger	i be work with eclipse ( indigo ) to develop c project . when i create a new c project in a new workspace , by default the " autosave before build " option be not set . this be extremely frustrating , as autosave be usually the default behavior in other ide 's i work on . i change some code , build and nothing seem to go as expect - until i remember that the option be not set ‚Ä¶ be there a way to make eclipse open a new workspace with this option set ?
__label__anger	@rob same problem , nothing . very disgusting
__label__anger	wide line be a #@$# in most diff'ing tool as well , which can make code review a pain .
__label__anger	com component be really a pain to manage , update , versioning , etc.
__label__anger	i have the problem that white be the " overscroll " color , not actually the fade edge . try this ( assume you want a fade edge , but not the horrid white glare when you hit the end ! ( otherwise set require fade edge to none )) :
__label__anger	for various reason microsoft decide that some info should be keep away from developer . but people through reverse engineering find out what these reserve field be about and produce their own documentation . some time people guess correct . some time microsoft make breaking change , and people scream " how dare you ! " . and life go on .
__label__anger	well asp . net be problematic by itself in many way . i can only imagine how the page be code , but mostly asp . net submits be do in a very painful way through _ dopostback where it set additional hidden field . you might want to try read this and review the generate html of the page
__label__anger	in bash , you use parameter expansion : in your case , say . no need to go overboard and cry for regexes at the slight provocation -- bash have plenty of power !
__label__anger	when run graphic base program in python for s0 ( pys0 ) the error message and the output of the print statement ( i.e. stdout ) be hide . if due to an error application stop work as expect its lose and track down the bug be very difficult , sometimes require run a " #ord# strip version " of the code . this be obviously painful . how do i log those error to a file , so that i may see them later .
__label__anger	you forget regression test - it be a real pain for a manual tester to run through #crd# of form just to check for some basic stuff which could be easy do automatic . well spare the tester this tedious stuff , so he can concentrate on the nasty testing .
__label__anger	so only workaround which work for me be to add this js to template of my site .. but its really awful solution , since i only need it in #crd# article / module
__label__anger	jam , the stack trace under that be just my function name . nothing more . very frustrating ‚òπÔ∏è
__label__anger	i guess i could do that . it 's just a pain when in microsoft word i can hold down shift and drag to do this , but i can not in visual studio !
__label__anger	i guess that work , but i would never do that . it 's scream bad practice . think about code readability etc ‚Ä¶ come back to your code in #crd# month and figure out all the function call inside your html markup .
__label__anger	i currently have speaker set up both in my office and in my living room , connect to my pc via #crd# sound card , and would like to switch the set of speaker i be output to on the fly . anyone know an application or a window api call that i can use to change the default sound output device ? it be currently a bit of a pain to traverse the exist control panel system .
__label__anger	im try to work with this awful language and i have to change an item of list by access to it with index i do nt understand the awful syntax of tcl ! how can i realise it ?
__label__anger	that 's an awful lot of swap hold and pattern space ‚Ä¶
__label__anger	the . net installation be #crd# of the most painful setup of all history , in all mean possible . i have do many such setup and about half of them even * crash * for xp.
__label__anger	because it be terribly difficult to get right . but i mention ` boost::iterator_facade ` .
__label__anger	when i refactor the follow line : use resharper 's " use object initializer " , i get the follow : i really hate this type of formatting because with long object name and variable it just get out of control . how can i get resharper to do the follow ?
__label__anger	regexes be fraught . a regex that split parameter on comma will get awfully confused if #crd# of the parameter be ` \ " hello , world ! \ " ` .
__label__anger	i use the gem for transparent usage of memcached . use the supply config file it be enable on all mode ( development , test , production ) . be there a way to only activate cache - money in production mode ? it 's not immediately clear how to do this , and it 's a total pain deal with caching in development mode .
__label__anger	be it possible to hide . svn file in the open resource dialog ( ctrl + shift + r ) of eclipse ? it 's very annoying when you have #crd# of file ‚Ä¶ cheer .
__label__anger	this be how i would do it ‚Ä¶ i really hate javascript popup ‚Ä¶
__label__anger	do a similar thing ( and yes , i find the ' pc ' moniker for window machine very disgusting )
__label__anger	our qa team use hp quality center for defect tracking , test plan , etc. the dev team really detest quality center and want to use jira for internal task tracking . can these #crd# system work seamlessly together ? i have work on project where team use separate issue - track system and keep them in sync be a major headache . anyone have real - world experience integrate quality center and jira ?
__label__anger	i really hate that object ‚Ä¶
__label__anger	enumerate all partition of a set be . now , all permutation of all partition of a set will be , although the example be a bit artificial . now , to come up with a useful algorithm it 's a totally different story . i be not aware of any such algorithm , and in any case its scaling will be absolutely awful .
__label__anger	downvote for not explain or give detail . i hate these type of question !
__label__anger	more than ? how about more than or ? remember the argument order in constructor be a real pain .
__label__anger	no , unless there 's a relevant ie #crd# day . obviously , this would be a huge abuse of user privacy ( if you want their name , ask them ! ) .
__label__anger	the screen which show whenever i start netbeans be very annoying , and among the #crd# of option i can not find the #crd# which turn it off ?
__label__anger	how do i change the position of the sort button in header of the grid in tapestry ? i have column name of different length and i break line on space , so the button , which be append to the end of the column name , always end up in different height . and that be very ugly ‚òπÔ∏è
__label__joy	get it : i need to reference the class type through the createjs module . i.e. work absolutely fine !

__label__joy	goooooooooooooood !
__label__joy	you be very welcome ! learn programming , it 's a lot of fun !
__label__joy	you should . it have a lot of good package . i find these package to help you with zip file for example : the npm registry be really amazing üôÇ
__label__joy	no worry , just run some test and see what fit good your usecase !
__label__joy	there be #crd# issue with your regex pattern : firstly , you forget to add the ^ at the beginning . this be why only the last character be check , or to say : you do not check the entire input . secondly , your cyrill check do not seem to be correct . still , i be not use to cyrillic letter and i should be careful before i judge üòâ hope it help !
__label__joy	hope it work , if you can upvote my answer i would really appreciate it ! üôÇ
__label__joy	maybe this will be of some help -
__label__joy	i have be use the jquery ui calendar / date picker with great success over the last couple month . i have be give a new requirement to allow for a week to be select ( sun - sat ) rather than a single day . have anyone accomplish this before ? highlight by week rather than day show beginning date and end date rather than single date in textbox / label
__label__joy	great ! i be glad you like it .
__label__joy	god , that be terrible ; i leave the link to my library as the #crd# i use for my own server . should work now ‚Ä¶ : ) and , pim , they be not entirely random ; the library 's for my own personal use , so i tend to just pick letter that make sense to me : [r] eturn , [s] teps , [g] radient , [f] ade count ‚Ä¶
__label__joy	if this be true that 's excellent news ! i will give it a try next app update ‚Ä¶
__label__joy	üôÇ üôÇ üôÇ üôÇ üôÇ üôÇ
__label__joy	write it down for you , hope it work as you expect !
__label__joy	hi i just start play with mongoose . it seem pretty awesome ! now come from a django background , how would #crd# implement a type of option field like : so that it can be set like status = open or something like that . or should this just be a normal string field and i set it accordingly in my app ?
__label__joy	i figure out , way of call the hub be not correct . for the time be i have modify my code as in global . asax :- work absolutely fine now üôÇ still figure out good alternative ! ! ! !
__label__joy	i can not find anything on google . this question be the last hope !
__label__joy	it prove the point . they be very excited about so now .
__label__joy	good luck with your image processing adventure ! i find it very fulfil on a technical level when i be in that area üôÇ
__label__joy	i stumble upon this site and really love the way they have do the navigation on the left hand site . i notice that site be use jquery but do nt see any plugins . any idea on how to go about do this ?
__label__joy	not for my company , so i do not have to worry üòâ
__label__joy	update the answer . this might help you ! great ! then you might want to edit the java program and have the permission specify while the folder be create do you try chmod with permission via terminal or php ?
__label__joy	ah , #crd# be a much less scary number !
__label__joy	here 's the king daddy of database wipe script . it will clear all table and reseed them correctly : enjoy , but be careful !
__label__joy	agree that you should ensure that your datum be properly index . apart from that , if you be worried about table size , you can always implement some type of datum archival strategy to later down the line . do not worry too much about this until you see problem crop up , and do not optimise prematurely .
__label__joy	do you run out of variable name ? üòâ
__label__joy	agile development can not be sell use documentation . instead , ask your management to let you be agile on a small pilot projet . for this pilot project , you must : - find a motivated end user to help you . - be free not to use the standard develop process of your company . then , succeed ! ! !
__label__joy	this work for me .
__label__joy	for all your keydown / keyup / keyboard need , use the jquery hotkeys plugin . see this a few month ago and it never fail to impress it . follow the jump for the plugin demo .. it map all key on a keyboard include combo . hope it help !
__label__joy	i be really glad it work ! btw , the good way to show appreciation on stack overflow if someone help to solve your problem be to upvote their answer and mark it as solve üôÇ
__label__love	oh , but [ request ] ( #hlink# * be * especially great . imho
__label__love	ahh , i do not know that the wsdl command line utility could generate #crd# file for many asmx ‚Ä¶ that s awesome ! i will try that out now . i can integrate that into our build process too . great , thank !
__label__love	no worry man !
__label__love	this might help you understand / explore thing a little bit more . an excellent article ! cheer !
__label__love	very direct question , i need to know if its possible and maybe where to start read about that . im a programmer with #crd# experience in window server and a client be ask if we can deliver in their window box ( and no they wo nt let us use any kind of virtualization in them ) . thanks guy , i know its not % programming related but ‚Ä¶ hope you can help üôÇ edit : wow , fast reply ! thanks guy ! ! !
__label__love	i have a xml similar to this #crd# : the thing be , im able to get all the info tag , but i get the result from all date . i do nt know what the date will be , since the be dynamic generate . what i know be that i may have a data tag with #crd# or #crd# date tag i wish i could show the #ord# date√¢¬¥s info on a list box and the #ord# date√¢¬¥s info on another listbox . how can i do that ? desirable output : if there√¢¬¥s a #ord# date then print it too : thx !
__label__love	almost work . you have to seek to #crd# less then write a byte , otherwise you still end up with a 0b file . still very helpful , thanks ! correct syntax too . if you want to edit , the extra line you need be outfile . writebyte ( ) ;
__label__love	excellent answer üôÇ
__label__love	have you actually implement this successfully ? it sound like a great solution !
__label__love	i think that solution be now ready . here 's the code : david wasser you be extremely helpful , thanks !
__label__love	no worry , i have definitely do that before while copy a url from jsfiddle !

__label__love	i have a query that be simply select from table . select from the comment table for all comment on an article select from userid table to find what kind of user it be if the user be #crd# type , search #crd# table‚Ä¶.else search another table for the final info . how would i go about this ? i be a little new at mysql stuff , so i totally appreciate your patience ! ps - let me know if this be nt clear ‚Ä¶ thanks !
