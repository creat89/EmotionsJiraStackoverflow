__label__fear	but i 'm afraid the cacheobject would get gc'ed not the data it caches .
__label__fear	it generate but i need but in i did not find a way how to change id attribute . i need to use text_field_tag because it fills textbox with params if submit fail . if i think about im worry if i change an id it does not fill a param ? !
__label__fear	was afraid someone would say that ‚Ä¶ ! is there any hack i could put in place ?
__label__fear	to be honest i do n't even know where to start . i guess the solution might entail using a zillion iif statements . i 'm fairly new to this i 'm afraid !
__label__fear	is there a sensible way to group long utc dates by day ? i would mod them by but that does n't take leap seconds into account . does anyone have any other ideas , i 'm using java so i could parse them into date objects , but i 'm a little worried of the performance overhead of using the date class . also is there a more efficient way than comparing the year month and day parts of a date object ?
__label__fear	its not one is it ? i have a method that gets five lists from different repositories . each call opens and closes a new datacontext . is this ok to do or should i wrap everything in one datacontext . in this case it is not straightforward to use the same datacontext , but i am afraid that opening and closing numerous datacontext in one page request is not good .

__label__joy	is it possible to re-open an . xcarchive file on xcode ? i know this is not common , but i would like to open a project exactly as it was submitted to the app store . i do n't have back up of that exact build , so it would be really great to open the archive copy ! before you ask why do n't i just download it from the store , i must say this build has been approved and is just pending on my release . üôÇ thanks !
__label__joy	then you might want to take full control over how preferences should follow your desired storage by implementing . you can see a linux based implementation here : good luck !
__label__joy	very interesting ! the code it produces does not work for me but the code is definitely useful as an example . i 'll mark this answer as accepted since it seems unlikely an actual reference that says more than msdn even exists .
__label__joy	you have to created a new model for hold referral code . below are given model syntax . add these lines in your last lines your models . py above mention line will create your user profile at the time of creating user . hope this work for you ! ! !
__label__joy	excellent ! look forward to hearing from you .
__label__joy	i would like to get back all the option selected of a multiple select when i submit my form . like : using somthing like that : and get an array with all the value selected like [ ' ' , ' ' ] all that , without jquery and in js or php is fine üôÇ thx !
__label__joy	excellent ! it 's very useful to me !
__label__joy	we ended up rolling our own , similar to figaro but with support for nested values , multiple files , and placeholders . it 's pretty awesome : !
__label__joy	i added an example of how to use the wraptext function . good luck with your project !
__label__joy	sure play around it , wp is easy it will just take a bit of time to get used to the structure .
__label__joy	code contracts are pretty cool , but they do have some limitations . they will only create compiler warnings , not errors . also , this analysis is pretty slow on large projects . however , i 'm hoping this technology will evolve and eventually be integrated into the language itself . it 's incredibly promising !

__label__joy	great üôÇ thanks !
__label__joy	indeed your question is an easy one , so i answer your question with some additional points that i think help you more than the answer itself:first , this is the code : notes : please1 - do n't a simple problem a real hard one ! if it 's a hw you can convince the tutor about defining the string delimited with something like " , " ( if he / she insists ) or whatever , and if this is a real project convince the customer , you do n't want to torture yourself ! - you said you want to split the string into a x matrix , what if you want a 5x5 matrix ? so take advantage of constants , and the same for the delimiter hope these help .
__label__joy	@catsby is correct -- you 'll want to use the to do this . sidenote : heroku 's platform api is actually incredibly awesome . you can use it to scale dynos , set variables , provision / deprovision addons , etc.

__label__joy	i can only repeat what others have said . parametrized sql is the way to go . sure , it is a bit of a pain in the butt coding it - but once you have done it once , then it is n't difficult to cut and paste that code , and making the modifications you need . we have a lot of . net applications that allow web site visitors specify a whole range of search criteria , and the code builds the sql select statement on the fly - but everything that could have been entered by a user goes into a parameter .
__label__joy	excellent - cool
__label__joy	that is what i am doing now . i find this a more practical solution and i see there are other people doing the same . well , great !
__label__joy	great , excellent . you 're welcome !
