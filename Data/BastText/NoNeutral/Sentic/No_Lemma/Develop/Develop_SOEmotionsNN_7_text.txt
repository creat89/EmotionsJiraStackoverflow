__label__fear	in my mental model of authentication , a user should be distinct from the way they log in. so for example , a user could have an associated emaillogin ( with an email / password ) , or they could have many ( or none ) . similarly they could have …* associated openidlogin credentials . are there any existing authentication libraries for rails which use this method ? alternatively , is this a really terrible idea ?
__label__fear	i am working on iphone app , at once it started showing me error , with no exception , i am really afraid of this error , can any one tell me why this is happening ?
__label__fear	it 's scary that there is no way , but i must agree because it 's fact .

__label__fear	i have a page running on my local django dev server with the django debug toolbar that seems to be running quite slowly but i 'm unsure why : django debug toolbar says sql - queries in ms and then running a profiler i get function calls ( primitive calls ) in seconds so i 'm left wondering why is the profile time so much lower than the total cpu time ? and then how can i find out what 's causing the difference ? and secondary to that - should i be worried about the involuntary context switches ! ?

__label__sadness __label__fear	has n't made a difference i 'm afraid ☹️
__label__sadness	yup many hours later i found that a single panel that was wrapped around the section had a enableviewstate = " false " added to it . sad part is that i know i did n't add that because i did n't even know what it was until craig here mentioned it . visual studio must have added it sometime .
__label__sadness	official guide says : tomcat deployment is trivial and requires copying the war file into the tomcat_home / webapps folder and restarting the container . but this is really painful ☹️ does there any way to deploy app without restarting tomcat ?

__label__sadness	i 'm afraid not ! afaik , the english resources are n't available at all in other international editions of the os .
__label__sadness	hate to say it , but i do n't think there is a way to alleviate this . i do think that it depends on the client system , though , so a faster javascript engine or machine may make it slightly more accurate .
__label__sadness	i did n't find a solution . thus , i delomboked the source code and done it with plain vanilla java … sad ☹️
__label__sadness	as mentioned on stackoverflow podcast - janrain rpx has beaten me . sad face for me .

__label__anger	all the formatting templates in eclipse will put the plus on the next row ( which i find really annoying ) , so you can simply apply the code formatter and the plus will end up on the next row .
__label__anger	the question on how to check input for validity is answered numerous times ! you just check whether the stream is in a good state . if not , you 'll reset the stream and ignore the character . search for question where this answered . also , do n't use exceptions for non-exceptional cases and * always * throw something derived from ` std::exception ` : once you have tried to locate where an exception came from which is n't derived from ` std::exception ` in a program with a few million lines of code you 'll find it extremely helpful to look at what ` what ( ) ` returns !
__label__anger	currently making a java program that grabs data off of a msaccess database and some of these errors are extremely frustrating . i keep getting this sql . exception : too few parameters . expected error on the last remaining bugs in this program . little background on the db : it has tables ( a player table ( columns ) , a team table ( columns ) , and an opponent table ( columns ) . these are both of the functions and i am fairly certain the problem lies in here somewhere or this function

__label__anger	it 's a very painful process to ajax ` files ` to a server side script . you might try : http://fineuploader.com/
__label__anger	i 've done some easy . hover ( function ( ) statement in jquery . when i hover over a text i simply want a # div . fadein , and on non-hover fadeout . it works . but it 's just if i spam the text - trigger with hover and un-hoverring really quickly and then stop the animation begin to give a blinking effect . it just kind of loops , really annoying !
__label__anger	got a spite downvote , it 's still a valid question .
__label__anger	i 'm trying to do this in a makefile and it fails horribly : do you know why ? i guess it has to do with escaping , but what and where ?
__label__anger	shortcut keys often do n't work the same way across all browsers . and they are awful on opera . and most users wo n't use them . the only thing i 'd bother with on most sites is buttons for next and prev , and i 'd also make the alt tag say " next " or " previous " to assist browsers with fast forward .
__label__anger	part of the reason why this is " dog slow " is that you are building the proxy every time you connect to the service . you could avoid this pain by using wsdl2ruby to build the proxy permanently and then call the pre-generated proxy .
__label__anger	that was a terrible article , it started out right , fisher - yates / knuth shuffle , then goes horribly wrong by trying to randomly order using guid as a source of randomness . do n't waste your time and just read the wikipedia article on fisher - yates or use a library that implements shuffle correctly .
__label__anger	that 's clever , but the performance must be horrible . not that i 'm saying there 's a better answer , just shuddering at the o ( n^ ) of it .
__label__anger	just let ie6 flicker . i do n't think it 's worth it to invest time in a dying browser when your base functionality works well enough . if you 're worried about flickering for accessibility reasons , just sniff for ie6 and replace the animation with a generic show ( ) and hide ( ) instead . i recommend avoiding complicated code for edge cases that do n't matter .
__label__anger	this is n't worthy of an " answer " , but i thought i 'd mention : many of the interfaces i 've really enjoyed have been minimalistic -- there 's almost nothing for me to see . like quicksilver for os x.

__label__anger	im maintaining a site where i need to ' click ' a link with javascript . the href is inline javascript , not a url so i ca nt just navigate to that url instead . im expect this is bad practice ( the rest of the site is terrible ! ) but i need to make the link ' clicked ' with javascript . im using jquery . i know this question has been asked before but it seems normally people are trying to follow the link , which i am not .

__label__anger	talking about feelings … i really hate the asp . net calendarextender …
__label__anger	you could achieve all this with reflection but it would lead to a really horrible code . you 'd better access individual members of the view model :
__label__anger	oh , man , i am sorry but i must say it : your code is really awful … it is not organised at all , but maybe … should n't be instead ? edit : try to comment the second and third queries , since they seem useless , and make the " cur " - > " cursor " change i suggested :
__label__anger	i 'm trying to output the following from within a liquid template : obviously , liquid sees this as a variable named and tries to do substitution . i 'm trying to find out how i can output the actual braces . so far , i 've found one method that works , but it 's incredibly ugly : yeah , told you it was gross . here are other things i 've tried : any advice here ?
__label__anger	( for the record , i find the infragistics winforms controls to be considerably easier than their asp . net controls . i think a lot of their bad rep comes from the asp . net side of the world , where certain tasks become a major pain and their viewstate usage is off the charts . )
__label__anger	currently the msbuild logs for team build are appalling as they are just plain text and are very difficult to read . also the ones created by my build are approx 30mb and take quite a while to download ( our tfs server is in our datacentre ) . does anyone know any way of being able to view these logs easier , prefereably integrated with either tfs itself or tfs webaccess ?

__label__anger	i do n't want to do anything fancy on twitter except post to it via my site once a day . i have searched around a bit and there are all sorts of super-complex ways to do every little thing that twitter does , but there seems to be little documentation on how to do the simplest thing , which is make a post ! does anyone know how to do this ? or can you at least point me in the right direction ? i do n't need full wrappers or anything ( ) , just one simple function that will post to twitter . thanks !
__label__anger	is not an , it 's a basic type . you can only add nsobject - derived objects to an nsarray . the exc_bad_access is probably because , under the covers , it 's trying to access an object stored at wherever your int is pointing to . in other words , it 's using your int as a pointer to an nsobject and failing horribly when it does so .
__label__anger	wo n't that be horribly distracting ?
__label__anger	believe me without an ide you just waste your time and it is a real pain ! if you feel that visual studio is expensive you can try the or go for or
__label__anger	the dreadful integer arithmetic attacks again ! when you calculate (( + + ) / ) , since all the operands are integers , ruby uses integer arithmetic rather than floating point arithmetic . if you do / it will also return , as it 's rounded down to the nearest integer , which is .
__label__anger	i had to do this once in notes for a plugin i was developing . what i ended up doing was editing the notes template in the designer , and then writing some lotusscript behind it that called a . net class via a dll. so when you clicked the button , it triggered the event in the lotusscript , and then called the dll , and passed the item information to it . i should also note that it was a freakin ' bear to figure out because notes documentation is terrible .
__label__anger	i have an android app that looks absolutely horrible if the user sets their font size to large or extra large ( via settings - > display - > font size in ice cream sandwich ) . it just plain was n't designed for variable font sizes , and it makes a lot of the text unreadable . i 've seen applications that preserve the font size for most views , so i know that there has to be a way to do this . is there a simple way for me to tell the application to ignore the user 's font size preference ? and if there is n't , how would you suggest that i go about calculating the font sizes ? if nothing else , is there a way for me to retrieve the user 's font size preference ?
__label__anger	there 's always the poor man 's alternative of just loading a bajillion individual frames as . gif / jpg / png and having javascript display them in sequence . it would be absolutely horrible for bandwidth and memory usage , and of course no audio , but it would ( somewhat ) simulate video being played . of course , on windows platforms , you could use activex and / or embed media player and play avi / wmv files as well , without ever touching flash .

__label__anger	this is extremely ugly c - style code , easy to get wrong . while the bugs in your code have been fixed by earlier birds , here is the c ++ way to do this :
__label__anger	i have a method that does a bunch of things ; amongst them doing a number of inserts and updates . it 's declared thusly … it works exactly as it is supposed to and i have no problems with it . there are situations however when i want to force the rollback in spite of there not being an exception … at the moment , i 'm forcing an exception when i encounter the right conditions , but it 's ugly and i do n't like it . can i actively call the rollback somehow ? the exception calls it … i 'm thinking maybe i can too .
__label__anger	getting the ssrs add - in to install properly was a complete pain . i think it had to do with the fact that we did development on the server prior to installing the ssrs add - in. i ended up un-joining the farm , re-joining it , then installing the component . that got it to work . then i just had to re-deploy solutions , re-activate features and re-configure my web . config .
__label__anger	so im using a simple submit binding to pass a function data : i just started working with ko so i was to write a basic print function to test this input out : my problem is when i hit submit i get a " you entered : undefined " but when i refresh the page the input that is in the form gets an alert . this is very frustrating ! idk if this is a knockout problem or a simple html one .
__label__anger	i have a function name called setvalue , used in many classes . also , i have a global function by the same name . when i press c - ] , it goes to arbitrary setvalue function . how do i directly jump to the global setvalue function ? it is really pain to use tnext every time to find if the function global .
__label__anger	upvote i was thinking of programming this myself . i really hate switching between my headphones and hdmi output .
__label__anger	why do so many people not understand the importance of permanent urls ? ? even adobe , selling products to build web applications , regularly fails at this !
__label__anger	dude i feel your pain , same issue here .
__label__anger	anti-javascript snobbery ! every language uses a separate platform on some level to parse and execute the code . javascript is just another language , capable of writing " programs " or " scripts " .
__label__anger	extremely lousy solution .
__label__anger	no i got errors saying undefined , the swf code loads the other pages such as back buttons etc. it very frustrating tearing my hair out !
__label__anger	i use neo4j tool to start neo4j in windows , but a strange thing is , today , when i open the neo4j shell , i start it , but no response , the status is in yellow and never turn to green , it ca n't establish neo4j server . it is so terrible for my database ! ! ! ! does anyone meet this ?
__label__anger	they sure did n't @michaelszyndel . it 's extremely frustrating . i am using the latest ver , too . i really would like to get it working properly .
__label__anger	@augustss : with ` impredicativetypes ` you can make monadic binds polymorphic as well ( though it requires a heck lot of extremely ugly type annotations ) .
__label__anger	i have a custom uitableviewcontroller class that is shared among a few viewcontrollers of my app . i would like to do pre-emptive fetching before the user has hit the bottom of the page . however , i noticed that if the user scrolls up and then down again , my vc will trigger another fetching . so i came up with a flag isfetching which checks to prevent double fetching . unfortunately i am running asynchronous code and i need a way to reset this flag after my fetching operation has completed . feedvc : delegate : i find it very painful to pass around a finish bloc in order to flip a boolean . does anyone have a better recommendation ?
__label__anger	ok , here 's one way of doing this , but it 's terrible ! i 'm still looking for an easier way :
__label__anger	ternary gets _ extremely _ ugly if you 're using more than one else statement , i would n't recommend it at all , let alone in this situation .
__label__anger	somewhat new to oop ( i.e. c programmer converting to c ++ ) and can not figure out why my data members in my backpack class are empty . i make pass an array of potions to my backpack , yet the data members are saying mtype = "" ( i.e. nothing ) . i have never felt this lost in a program before . starting to hate oop ( i.e. kidding….but this extremely frustrating ) . main . cpp potion . cpp backpack . cpp
__label__anger	i 'm nearly reaching rage mode ! can anyone help me with this ? ? i setted a limit on a codeigniter model so i can only that set of results . why is it not working ? the records are displaying correctly on function call , but i 'm getting more than how it 's supposed to
__label__anger	yup , wcf is a world of config pain , stick to asmx
__label__anger	i 'm trying to insert the following array ( from a html form ) but i believe i 'm working with this array in a very awful way the array : actual code : ? > current output : what would be a decent way to do it ? edit : no need to show how to connect to a database , i just need to deal with the array data .
__label__anger	i was intending on use the title attribute in the @page directive to customise each pages title , but it simply does n't appear to do anything . the site uses master pages - i do n't know if that is a consideration . master page snippet : page snippet ( from ) : what is more , if i run the page through the , it complains about … end tag for " head " which is not finished .. whereas the the tag is present in the source code . i 've already got a workaround in place , but it 's annoying the hell out of me , so i 'm determined to find a resolution !
__label__anger	for c # visual studio uses spaces by default , whereas for c ++ it is hard - tabs . why is it so ? why is it different ? my project consists of both c # and c ++ code and the difference really annoys me . i want to set a common standard for all the sources , but i wonder if this would have any drawbacks .
__label__anger	i am currently scripting blender right now but it 's excruciatingly slow for large models .
__label__love __label__anger	next time you could try doing some research yourself ? however a quick search of google comes up with a few nice looking tutorials . ( assuming by xaml and c # you mean wpf ? ) also try looking at visifire charts trial , it 's quite excellent !
__label__joy	very excited for my first post on so ! i would like to create an animation like in xcode i am not having much luck with what cabasicanimation has to offer . feels like i may need one of those fancy physics engines … (?) how would one properly begin do this ? thanks !
__label__joy	press ctrl + c and keep on processng ctrl. query was killed for me … 🙂 ubuntu
__label__joy	take a look at this , and rejoice ! 🙂
__label__joy	in my winforms app ( c #) i have a circle ( defined by a ) that i am presently filling with a solid color . i would like to fill this with a circular ( not linear ) gradient ( so one color in the center fades to another color uniformly around the edges ) . i have experimented with , but am having no luck ( i still see a solid color ) . if anyone has any sample code that does this , that would be terrific !
__label__joy	@jonathan : i do n't think it 's the only sane way to do it 😛 . great answer though !
__label__joy	@ecu - excellent 🙂 i added an answer so future googlers can find the answer a bit easier , it seems comments are n't looked at nearly as often when scanning for the reason .
__label__joy	actually , i 've just fixed it . fiddled with colorbox and got it working . i 'm running it in a function every time the images change , which did n't seem to work with the previous lightbox plugin but does with this one . hurray !
__label__joy	i ca n't help , but good luck ! what a great game that was . will this be a commercial release ?
__label__joy	great work in finding that bug report ticket ! i was able to see the issue in the [ fiddle ] ( http://jsfiddle.net/5scnj/) that they provided . notice also that the bug has been fixed ! all you need to do is use a jquery - ui > = version . i forked their fiddle and tried it with and the issue goes away . check it out [ here ] ( http://jsfiddle.net/mcoomey/jpc4j/ /). @user3496151 : the fix that i demonstrated in the previous
__label__joy	great descriptions of all the answers !
__label__joy	i 'm wondering if its possible to join together ienumerable 's . basically i have a bunch of users and need to get their content from the database so i can search and page through it . i 'm using linq to sql , my code at the moment it : i hope that make some sense ! matt
__label__joy	reviewing the msdn docs for the functions listed , i see that the function checks with the smbios table , which is referenced by a standard it appears that you indeed can find the information you seek through the bios . you may have to install a driver to get that information out to your program . good luck !
__label__joy	rofl ! upvoted for the hilarious title ! 😃
__label__joy	i have used very successfully ( with a tweakette here or there ! )
__label__joy	if it would n't have been a programming question , the answer of your title would be priceless 🙂
__label__joy	if you would like to switch to different network operators - the answer is no , you are not able to do that programmatically . there is no api that supports that . if you want to switch to different wireless networks the answer is yes , read post . if you would like to check for different kinds of connectivity states - look . good luck , hope this helped !
__label__joy	i found the answer ! it appears to be an issue with sending to the development device tokens . like most people , we have a database that stores the device tokens , and the earlier records were populated with our device tokens from testing . as soon as i net out those device tokens from my list , all works ! i really hope someone finds this useful !
__label__joy	@joe yes , if i were to declare the property and synthesize it as above , but i do n't explicitly declare an ivar myself , the compiler will still actually create the ivar . so i could do ` int len = [ self . stringproperty length ] ` as you 'd expect inside the class , and i can also do ` int len = [ stringproperty length ] ` as well , without using the accessor method , just directly using the ivar ( which the compiler has synthesized for me , along with setter + getter ) . it 's really fantastic !
__label__joy	what you can do here is hide the button that pushes the view that only instructors can see , if the user is logged in is of type student . in the view that has the button that pushes the view that only instructors can use do this:in the . h file create a property for the button that pushes the view like so : in the . m file:in the viewwillappear method of the view do the following check : this way , when the view loads , the button that pushes the instructor view will only be accessible to the users of type " instructor " .hope it helps !
__label__joy	you can use this hope this helps !
__label__joy	you may be looking for a solution similar to josh smith 's "" . in his article , he presents the following : and then uses the multi-value converters as follows : hope this helps !
__label__joy	everytime i restart my computer another ethernet adapter local area connection is created . i 've tried to search the web for other people having same issue , but without luck . hope you guys can help me out , it would be extremely helpfull !
__label__joy	since i was also looking for a way to use the empty word epsilon i came up with the following approach . i simply used an empty production rule such as : hope it works - at least for now it seems so ... addendum : it works pretty fine 🙂
__label__joy	got some help from . here is my java class : i used for the base64 encoding . here 's my c # class : i really hope this helps someone else !
__label__joy	i do n't think that it is possible to compare a shelved version with a local version in visual studio , however i 'll be very happily corrected on the matter .
__label__joy	to expand on my comment , if you do n't already see then benefits of relative positioning then i 'll assume you are a begginer . here is a useful video to help you re-design you page : also , this is useful for comparing when each positioning method is best used : and finally a general website that will be extremely useful for you in the near future may be !
__label__joy	just use rotateflip : as @dan - o has pointed out , this allows a rotation of any of the degree 's in the enum . to rotate a bitmap any angle without losing the size , you could do the following , but it 's a bit convoluted ! one - add the library to your project two - add the xaml , windowsbase and presentationcore libraries to your project three - use the following to rotate your bitmap any amount of degrees : pain in the ass , but works !
__label__joy	excellent ! it works !
__label__joy	sweet 🙂 happy hacking !
__label__joy	found this on gamasutra a while ago : hope it helps !
__label__joy	here is an answer to a similar question : it 's a complex workaround , but looks working pretty fine !
__label__joy	it would be a good practice to have a separate button that will disable method since it is very easy to get confused when using your program if the code for disabling and enabling this method is all written in one method named so i suggest you separate them to make the program 's design more precise . next thing you can do is to execute a , whic you are going to mark as . after having done this you can use . here 's how : be warned that it 's sometimes dangerous to throw exceptions as it creates some other bugs , but this option wo n't hurt much if you 're just trying to disable a function . by the way , this will really not remove the method as it will just replace it , it 's now up to you to choose which method will receive this . hope this was helpful !
__label__love __label__joy	got it ! thank you all for helping me reach a great " aha ! " moment 🙂 ... hopefully after i spend some more time in wpf i 'll understand why this works .
__label__love __label__joy	claims to : export balsamiq mockups to html / css / js and adobe flex at a click of a button . balsamiq 's perfect companion no coding skills required pays for itself after one use if it really " works " napkee could be extremely useful . does napkee work as advertised ? what is the quality of the exported html ? is it a must - have companion to balsamiq ( which i love ) ?
__label__love __label__joy	i am currently using the following jquery script to highlight rows in my table , and it works great ! this works great for tables of data where each row is truly a new record , however , i have run into an issue where i have records that take up two rows of data and would like to modify the jquery so it renders something like : how would i accomplish this in jquery where i want every 3rd row to have a class of ' alt1 ' and every 4th row to have a class of ' alt2 ' ? thanks in advance !
__label__love __label__joy	it is all good , i found this to be very helpful . the following article is excellent !
__label__love __label__joy	new to programming and this is my very first post ! very exciting :d thank you all in advance for sharing your expertise . i would like to be able to somehow reference the earlier created timer and to be able to extend it ( call change upon its instance perhaps ? ) on button2_click . please take a look at the code below :
