__label__fear	give the dependency ; i do not think this be go to be an option for the cannonical strut distribution ; unless it be rework to use ibatis or cayenne .
__label__anger	you be mix runtime . you must link _ all _ executables with the same run - time library . for release ; it 's multithreaded dll ; for debug ; it 's debug multithreaded dll. otherwise ; bad thing will happen when memory allocate from #crd# heap be free in another . i rebuild your code with the appropriate setting ; and everything work fine . see the project setting dialog box ; c / c ++ tab ; and the ' code generation ' category .
__label__anger	> we can not let fear of back - compat prevent us from make progress .
__label__anger	bq. this be solr 's fault by have a getter that do some heavy duty xml shit .
__label__anger	it 's my bad .
__label__anger	not pretty .
__label__anger	hmm .. this be quite bad .
__label__anger	damn , it seem it do not work .
__label__anger	sun ri suck , why the hell be savestate ( ) and restorestate ( ) not call with with #hlink# _ saving_method = server ? ? ?
__label__anger	ok , wow , welcome to linux hell â€¦
__label__anger	css be really confusing sometimes .
__label__anger	what the hell ? !
__label__anger	this look reasonable to me â€¦ suck we have to special case handling of " " ..
__label__anger	here be quite bad .
__label__anger	ah - my bad .
__label__anger	my bad .
__label__anger	* damn * , i forget .
__label__anger	actually i do not want to specify the encoding , because i do not care how the datum be transport to me .
__label__anger	where on earth be you anyway ?
__label__anger	and i think if we be go to do a sweep up of shit , we should just kill root .
__label__anger	downvote to jar hell .
__label__anger	it seem some of the wrapper in ink_hrtime.h ( ) might no longer be use either , e.g. ink_gettimeofday ( ) be never use , so let s get rid of that shit .
__label__anger	bq. here 's a patch for the general case , and it also add a warning that you should set your similarity with similarity . setdefault , especially if you omit norm . be there no way to remove this stupid static default and deprecate similarity . ( g | s ) etdefault ( ) ? can we not use the similarity from indexwriter for the case of normswriter ?
__label__anger	my bad .
__label__anger	do not hate me , just throw this out there .
__label__anger	doh .

__label__sadness	i be not aware of be require to call that method .
__label__sadness	otis , you need to grab the ' zip ' version aka #hlink# ( since june ) . i be try to be space & bandwidth friendly â€¦ sorry i do not make it more obvious in some previous comment . henri
__label__sadness	unfortunately , we can not do that , because that be not explicit on the spec javadoc , and there be a way to do what be expect use " target " property .
__label__sadness	sorry if this spam 's thing , however it 's unlikely that i will work on these .
__label__sadness	this be a silly #crd# .
__label__sadness	sorry , after investigation , the real source of the problem be when a tag be use dot ( < #hlink# > ) apparently , xmlconfiguration do not support this . should it ?
__label__sadness	sorry [ ~ fiberlijun ] - have nt have a chance to look at it yet .
__label__sadness	unless we switch to antlr ( and even though , i be not sure this would fix the problem ) , there be nothing we can do .
__label__sadness	it do not look very useful .
__label__sadness	hi guillaume , i do not have an answer right away , so i send you question to leonard rosenthol .
__label__sadness	sorry typo : " our part " in place of " #crd# part " above .

__label__sadness	sorry , but look at mapsubtract and far down in the source you will find plenty .

__label__love	thanks tucu ! you be right . i have not think of that . i be on the fence because we be serialize a process which should happen fast ( so parallelizing be good ) . like you already mention bq. * add a method in the filesystem to disable its shutdown hook . mrappmaster would disable it and call closeall ( ) explicitly ( it already do ) . this be already present ( by set conf . setboolean ( " #hlink# " , false ) ) so i be not sure what problem this jira be fix . or be we plan for the future ? i be fine with the latter answer be yes . i be just curious . the patch look good for what it intend to do , although the late #crd# do not include the fix you make in response to nicholas ' comment .
__label__love	#ord# sorry for the delay . it look like this patch slip through . i try to apply it , but there be a bunch of conflict ( some of them be related to recent docstring format change and other seem to be related to other change ) . can you please re-generate the patch against the late trunk ? thanks !
