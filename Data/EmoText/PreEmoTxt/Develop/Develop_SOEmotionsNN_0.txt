Here's what I did in my app at work to handle the significant volume of seed data we are required to use: My seeds.rb file: A sample seed file in the seeds/ folder: This has the effect of loading our seed files in the desired order (using 01_ then 02_, etc.). It also breaks up our seeds into logical groupings and organizes them in such a way that, for our team, we can more easily manage them."
"I have just about finished adding all of the content to each page of my website. I've noticed, however, when I navigate between links some of the pages shift to the right about 10 px or so. This is extremely irritating. All of my pages are contained within the same container using a fluid grid. However, not all pages have the same amount of content. I noticed that pages with empty divs don't shift when I navigate between them. However, if I navigate from a page with content to a page with little or no content, I see the shift. Should this be happening if all of my pages are using the same container, same fluid grid? Does this make sense? Can you sense my desperation?"
Very painful and doesn't work with inputs from the user.
"@Kev its a deployment headache, you can ilmerge it in ... but still its an extra bit of luggage you need to worry about"
"I find it comes back periodically. What's most frustrating about it is that everytime it does come back, it breaks WebDeploy as the account under which that runs does not have access to delete the aspnet_client folder created!"
"Does anyone commit Qt to their own source control? If so, how do you do it? Do you commit the whole Qt directory or do you pick only the ones that your application needs (bin/lib/include/src) How do you handle the case when new Qt version comes out? I'm asking because I'm trying to setup Build automation and Qt moc is a bit of a pain...and just wondering how people handle committing 3rd party library in general."
"The move to version 7 is painful, I totally agree. Our process has taken just as long (and seems to be stretching out forever) - especially coming away from Rational Suite into individual v7 products."
"This has nothing to do with but everything to do with the absolutely awful markup of your HTML and the lack of . You're going to want to wrap all of this ""free-text"" inside of a or two, and then make sure you're putting the inside of the Sample CSS: HTML:"
"Same server, i'm using phpMyAdmin and its being a pain saying i'm not using it the right context!?"
"Too slow and I prefer to operate in the same mode as my users. Also, I just really hate switching to debug. And its a waste of diskspace."
"Usability notes: Personally I hate when sites put the ""forgot password"" or ""forgot username"" or ""help"" links inbetween the password field, and the Login button. As a keyboard user, I shouldn't have to TAB over them to get to the submit button. Better yet, also capture the Enter keypress on the password field so that I can auto-submit with the Enter key."
"Crashes for me on a virtual machine without Flash loaded. I hate annoying Flash embeds as much as the next guy, but â€œusing it is BADâ€ might be overegging it slightly..."
"I am having trouble with adding text to the RichTextBox with tabs in it. I have code similar to this: And when I do this I can see tabs in paragraphs that start with '\t' but if I actually delete the tab then press the Tab key, the indentation is wrong. In fact it's about half the size exactly. Also if I tab in the middle of a line the tabbing is different. Also when I pull the Text out of the TextRange lines that start with tabs appear to not generate '\t's generated by pressing the Tab key. This is incredibly frustrating. Does anyone have advice or ideas how to work with this?"
whatever generated this code is terribly broken!
"I'll bet you that your main's function signature is incorrect. You use: but SDL_main.h wants Aside: You see, SDL does something really horrific when compiling: It renames your function to , injecting its own main function which, in turn, calls yours. Note that if this doesn't work, then you may be compiling with wrong flags. To be sure, take the flags by running: For more information, see"
"StyleCop has rules that seem to differ from MS's prior style guides. For example, StyleCop hates m_ and _ for prefixs to private members. Also, the VS default code generation violates StyleCop by putting using statements outside the namespace. *sigh*"
@JJ That was the mistake JJ. Plain Oversight and extremely ridiculous.
"Compare these two methods: Aside from the method signatures (bar can declare instead of ), is there any practical difference between the two methods? To be clear: I'm aware that this is a horrible approach to exception handling, and should not be done!"
This answer is not optimal because I have no clue which Konrad you are referring to.
"I am trying to make a search TextBox with an embedded magnifying glass icon. I have the following markup so far: However, I can't find the entry in SystemColors which will give me the same color as the standard TextBox border. This is a blueish color by default. Am I being really stupid here?!? EDIT: btw, the image is contained in a stackpanel because I'm planning to put a dropdown arrow in there as well."
here's my hack that assumes arguments are all imaginary: ...horrible! but what you ask for isn't really possible without for instance hacking to dispatch to a new subtype of java.lang.Number. Really it would make more sense to use a Java or Clojure complex number library.

"The 0x1A byte is a terrible, painful [source of agony](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12483711/serialdata-eof-circumstances)."
"Tools to automate alteration of markup code for any objective are a horribly frightful proposition. Simply write your code correctly the first time. If you have archaic code then it likely has many other problems in addition to SEO, and automatically imposing global changes can expose problems you may not be prepared to address."
"I'm developing an OSX application () that runs with LSUIElement set (system menu only - no tray icon, doesn't appear in cmd-tab). It works totally fine, but someone just pointed out that it has a blank process name in the Activity Monitor listing. Just says nothing. Everything else in there has a name. Even other apps running at LSUIElement. I've tried to search around the web, but I can't spot anyone talking about this. What on earth should I be looking for?"
"I have a that has three views per cell, with three cell displaying on the view at one time (for a total of nine views). Think of it as a bookshelf. Sometimes I can have as many as 500 books. I've added shadow to the with code that is this: When I add the shadow code, as seen above, scrolling performance is just totally killed and becomes choppy. Each image has a different so the shadow has to be created for each item as it scrolls. Anyone have any tips on how to add shadows to my images on a without having this issue?"
"Here is a solution that works for lower case strings only. Horrible horrible code, but I was trying to see how few lines I could write a solution in."
"WTF??? Why not just mark Enrico's answer as Answer instead of copying it over and marking your own answer? Stealing is bad, m'kay?!"
"Is it possible to use Twitter's API to grab search results? For example, if I wanted my page to show all tweets (man I hate that term) with the word ""cat"" in it? Is it also possible to get just the matching results that were after a certain date?"
"We have released a beta version of our software, and as we talked to people who started using it, we have found that a lot of the features (which we thought were essential) were not known and not used by the users. What are the possible ways to inform the application users about the features of the application? I personally find the ""Tip of the day"" popups extremely annoying and disable them quickly. Are there better ways?"
"I am building the Android OS on Mac OSX (Lion), and Eclipse as an IDE. I am trying to understand certain parts of the OS however this requires performing many searches throughout the project. These searches take 5 or 10 minutes on Eclipse, and the way they are presented is also extremely annoying. Also, I need a separate editor to open up the native files found in the OS, since if they are opened in Eclipse there is no color coding of the C++ syntax. I feel that Eclipse is really slowing me down - can anyone suggest a better IDE for browsing the Android OS (preferably free)?"
"I have various files that I want to be ignored by SVN when committing. I know that I can go into TortoiseSVN and ignore them in various ways. I know that I can run svn propedit svn:ignore from the command line to do the same thing. The problem is that I have to have everyone on my team to do that, which is a pain. Is there a way that I can put some file in a folder or set something in my SVN repository that tells it to never check a certain file in?"
"Consider the following example: In the above example, inside filterOccupied I have to use four for matching type. This becomes really painful when the records has more than ten fields. Is there a better way to do this ?"
"The documentation for the minitest-ci gem (seemingly the only option for producing test results for a CI tool such as Jenkins) has the extremely annoying habit of not preserving the results of when invoked as - the test results from running minitest:models are deleted prior to running the rest of the tests. minitest-ci's barely-extant documentation claims adding this to test_helper.rb will disable the troublesome auto-clean behavior, but it doesn't: Has anyone out there managed to get minitest-ci to preserve all the test result files? I'm reaching wits' end here."
Such awful code!
Coding horror!!!
"For what it's worth, NSCollectionView does this too (you can see it in action in the IconCollection sample code). They apparently wait for a ""quiet period"" in which you've stopped dragging. I've been trying to write a similar class, and it is definitely a pain to get the animations to run consistently and properly during the resize."
Then you should be more specified in asking the question. You confused me..
"Cool, that was going to be my next suggestion! Good luck :)"
I SOLVED IT! I used YouTube API and it works fine :) Thank you for your help!!
Excellent! Thanks for the info.
"@Chris, excellent, I'm thrilled to hear that you're migrating to salted hashes! :)"

Excellent! Worked perfectly!
"I have been struggling with the same issue, the Facebook docs on this are awful, but finally I worked it out: Hoe that helps!"

Wow - why would someone vote to close? This is a great debate!!
I would be extremely shocked if this was possible.
"I'm not good at programming and my trying to open one of my spreadsheet documents. Below in the basic login im using, I then request a list all my spreadsheet, which is returned in $feed. And now I'm worried I'm not on the right track with opening a document so I can read and write cells."

One of my tables in my SQL database has a growth rate of two nibbles per nanosecond. I was wondering how many megabytes per day that is and should I be worried? My hard disk is 150 GB.
