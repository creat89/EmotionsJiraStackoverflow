__label__fear	given the dependencies ; i do n't think this is going to be an option for the cannonical struts distribution ; unless it is reworked to use ibatis or cayenne .
__label__love __label__sadness	thanks tom ; sorry for the mess .
__label__surprise	what was the outcome of the discussion ?
__label__surprise	why is it unsafe to share filter in selectstatement for nqf ?
__label__sadness	otis , you need to grab the ' zipped ' version aka solr- .patch.zip ( since june ) . i was trying to be space & bandwidth friendly â€¦ sorry i did not make it more obvious in some previous comments . henri
__label__sadness	sorry , forgot that dev lists were merged before jmeter was made tlp
__label__sadness	my error .
__label__sadness	git is tricky that way .
__label__sadness	sorry if this spam 's things , however it 's unlikely that i 'll work on these .
__label__sadness	sorry avdhesh , i forgot to add these two files to the patch , here is the new patch containing the missing files
__label__sadness	hi guillaume , i did not have an answer right away , so i sent you question to leonard rosenthol .
__label__sadness	unfortunately , we ca n't do that , because that is not explicit on the spec javadoc , and there is a way to do what is expected using " targets " property .
__label__sadness	oh , signed shift !
__label__sadness	i am not really sure what does the receive payment do before the shipment , it does n't sound as if it is doing what we expect it to do .
__label__sadness	sorry [ ~ fiberlijun ] - have nt had a chance to look at it yet .
__label__sadness	hi marco , i changed the name of patch because it was made in java earliar , sorry for inconvenience .
__label__sadness	sorry everyone .
__label__sadness	sorry for your time .
__label__sadness	sorry again .
__label__sadness	it does not look very useful .
__label__sadness	that is a bit too lax i think .
__label__sadness	sorry , after investigation , the real source of the problem is when a tag is using dots ( < a.variable > ) apparently , xmlconfiguration does not support this . should it ?
__label__sadness	sorry , in rushing to commit i forgot to add author during the commit .
__label__sadness	sorry , i forgot to change the priority of this one .
__label__sadness	hi rupert ! sorry it took so long but i thought i 'd test building in a linux environment too so i set up a centos machine running maven and java .6_41 . got the exact same error on both machines . i have attached corresponding logs both from windows8 and centos to this issue . link here : https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/ /surefire_reportsr1450112_win8_centos6. .zip kind regards esse edit : i 'll also run mvn clean install for just jenatdb with logging when i get home .
__label__sadness	sorry , my bad . let me upload what i have .
__label__sadness	igor , sorry it took me so long to get back to this .
__label__sadness	unless we switch to antlr ( and even though , i 'm not sure this would fix the problem ) , there is nothing we can do .
__label__sadness	okay , i 'm convinced . sorry about the wait . as an apology i have coded up the url - based version in v3 . ( have n't actually tested it on non-local files though , but it compiles . ðŸ™‚
__label__sadness	{ quote } because they are non-javadoc eclipse - related only , and not everybody uses eclipse . { quote } ouch â€¦ sorry about that . you will not see that again .
__label__sadness	sorry , but look at mapsubtract and further down in the source you will find plenty .
__label__sadness	sorry typo : " our part " in place of " one part " above .
__label__sadness	sorry timothy , i forgot to include a couple of dlls , gtou . dll and gtoud . dll in the test tool that i uploaded last friday . i have added them to cms_test_tool.7z . they are under cms_test_tool\dll . please register one of these dlls ( for example gtoud . dll ) to compile cmsmessagehandlercom . thanks ! helen
__label__sadness	sorry , last patch was missing new files
__label__sadness	this is a silly one .
__label__sadness	qianshi is working on the ssl session reuse , but this buggy bug system does not allow him assign this ticket , sigh
__label__sadness	sorry i missed some of this the first time .
__label__sadness	i was not aware of being required to call that method .
__label__sadness	keep repeating this and the problem just gets worse .
__label__anger	damn , it seemed it did n't work .
__label__anger	this looks reasonable to me â€¦ sucks we have to special case handling of " " ...
__label__anger	ok , wow , welcome to linux hell â€¦
__label__anger	> we ca n't let fear of back - compat prevent us from making progress .
__label__anger	actually i do n't want to specify the encoding , because i do n't care how the data is transported to me .
__label__anger	downvote to jar hell .
__label__anger	it 's my bad .
__label__anger	do n't hate me , just throwing this out there .
__label__anger	* damn * , i forgot .
__label__anger	doh .
__label__anger	my bad .
__label__anger	hmm ... this is quite bad .
__label__anger	css is really confusing sometimes .
__label__anger	it seems some of the wrappers in ink_hrtime.h ( ) might no longer be used either , e.g. ink_gettimeofday ( ) is never used , so let s get rid of that shit .
__label__anger	not pretty .
__label__anger	bq. here 's a patch for the general case , and it also adds a warning that you should set your similarity with similarity . setdefault , especially if you omit norms . is there no way to remove this stupid static default and deprecate similarity . ( g | s ) etdefault ( ) ? can we not use the similarity from indexwriter for the case of normswriter ?
__label__anger	sun ri sucks , why the hell is savestate ( ) and restorestate ( ) not called with with javax.faces.state _ saving_method = server ? ? ?
__label__anger	and i think if we 're going to do a sweep up of shit , we should just kill root .
__label__anger	the evil npe strik back ! !
__label__anger	but , even if it was n't it would be totally worthless where it is at .
__label__anger	ah - my bad .
__label__anger	where on earth are you anyway ?
__label__anger	you are mixing runtimes . you must link _ all _ executables with the same run - time library . for release ; it 's multithreaded dll ; for debug ; it 's debug multithreaded dll. otherwise ; bad things will happen when memory allocated from one heap is freed in another . i rebuilt your code with the appropriate setting ; and everything worked fine . see the project settings dialog box ; c / c ++ tab ; and the ' code generation ' category .
__label__anger	my bad .
__label__anger	here is quite bad .
__label__anger	bq. this is solr 's fault by having a getter that does some heavy duty xml shit .
__label__anger	what the hell ? !
__label__love	thanks erwan for you 're effort ðŸ™‚

__label__love	thanks a lot , jon for signing up this .
__label__love	hello , thanks a lot ! it works . lisa
__label__love	committed to branch and trunk , thanks gab !
__label__love	hi tri , those files looks good . i cursorily checked only.commonuilabels.xml.patch but from their sides i guess the others are good as well . but done from the ofbiz roo directory , it 's the main ofbiz directory where you fine the license and apache2_header files . anyway not a big deal i will try to apply them as is and will let you know you do n't have to remove the old files , as you can see they are now grayed , and it 's good that you checked the grant license box . thanks
__label__love	i like richards update as well ðŸ™‚ what i did was out of pure anger so it may not have been the sexiest .
__label__love	i would love to have it right now for storm too . if you want me to sign up as a use case i am happy to .
__label__love	added in rev . thanks will !
__label__love	thank you , + harit himanshu
__label__love	thanks tucu ! you are right . i had not thought of that . i 'm on the fence because we are serializing a process which should happen fast ( so parallelizing is good ) . like you already mentioned bq. * add a method in the filesystem to disable its shutdown hook . mrappmaster would disable it and call closeall ( ) explicitly ( it already does ) . this is already present ( by setting conf . setboolean ( " fs.automatic.close " , false ) ) so i 'm not sure what problem this jira is fixing . or are we planning for the future ? i 'm fine with the latter answer being yes . i 'm just curious . the patch looks good for what it intends to do , although the latest one does n't include the fixes you made in response to nicholas ' comments .
__label__love	thanks for the patch erik ( and jon )
__label__love	thanks for taking a look bikas and devaraj . committing this .
__label__love	thanks anton . fix applied to accessibility module at repo revision r598652 . please check it is fixed as you expected .
__label__love	patch committed to trunk thanks hari !
__label__love	committed ! to branch hadoop - eclipse - merge . thanks srimanth .
__label__love	first sorry for the delay . it looks like this patch slipped through . i tried to apply it , but there are a bunch of conflicts ( some of them are related to recent docstring format changes and other seem to be related to other changes ) . can you please re-generate the patch against the latest trunk ? thanks !
__label__love	agreed , the current behavior is incorrect , i just did n't want you disappointed . ðŸ™‚ if you create your singleton jira patch before this one is applied , then just include them together and close this bug . i agree that commit rights would make this simpler and supplying patches is the primary way to gain commit rights , so you are on the right path regardless what happens with pax web . ðŸ™‚
__label__love	forgot to mention : thanks to alejandro and his team for pointing this one â€¦
__label__love	hi , im sujan . i need to send proposal for gsoc for airavata- . how can i do it ? please let me know the steps what should i do ? thank u email : hardsujan@gmail.com
