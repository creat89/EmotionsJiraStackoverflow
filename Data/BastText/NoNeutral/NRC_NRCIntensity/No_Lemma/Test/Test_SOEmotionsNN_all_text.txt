__label__anger	by the way , i agree with henrik p. hessel . this is a very horrible piece of code .
__label__anger	as you can see folks hate spending time giving details on bad advice !
__label__anger	the two are not mutually exclusive , archmage .
__label__anger	it 's impossible to receive unicast udp packets in silverlight ( rage ! ! ! ) .
__label__anger	that is awful advice ! i do n't mean to be overtly mean but i lolled .
__label__anger	oh , absolutely horrible practice . but still the answer he was looking for .
__label__anger	tried it again - it worked . god i hate reporting services !
__label__anger	someone is scared to tell the reason of downvote !
__label__anger	i have just started using vim in a terminal ( putty or mintty ) , after always using gvim . however , when using syntax highlighting , rather than the actual text colour changing appropriately , its background is changed to whatever colour -- and it looks horrible ! i 've set my terminal to use colours and downloaded a colour colour scheme . i checked that the and settings are as i expect , but i still get this problem … is this a vim or a terminal configuration issue ?
__label__anger	i am developing a web page which embedded a " google maps " view . in this web page , the user must specify several positions on the maps at this time , i am able to spread the balloons on the map displayed when the user click on a button to be dragged , but according to the zoom it can be very painful to zoom in and out to drag the balloon to a place . i would like to know if it could be possible to have a panel with all balloons to drag / drop on the map ? my current development : my target :
__label__anger	i 'm doing one app which requires ajax call on almost every user interaction possible , i started writing js functions , webservices etc. to handle all of that ( still long way to go from here ) . now i am wondering if i made a mistake maybe i should put whole page in update panel because i really hate writting js. is there some drawback to use it instead of custom written ajax calls to web service and js functions , and is it better to use more update panels or one big ?
__label__anger	i 'm trying to do this in a makefile and it fails horribly : do you know why ? i guess it has to do with escaping , but what and where ?
__label__anger	done … stackoverflow makes you wait several minutes . i really hate that
__label__anger	why would you do that ? you 're begging for horrible debugging sessions !
__label__anger	i do n't see how this is possible , but i really , really hate to run my query an extra time just to get the record count so i can build a pager . when i say a " pager " i simply mean the common gizmo with a link for each records for example .
__label__anger	edit : also you should avoid using it can make debugging extremely frustrating .
__label__anger	ew , the ` com ` prefix is horrible !
__label__anger	i wrote something that does work , but it 's extremely ugly , but thought it could either help someone else or we could get something better . here 's what i came up with :
__label__anger	i am very jealous of your name !
__label__anger	ef ctp5 is still having this bug ! anyway there is a simple work around for now see more here : be aware that count ( ) is total rubbish performance wise !
__label__anger	as was already established , this is a miserable , horrible , awful , and terrible idea from a concurrency perspective . anyway , since your question is really about go 's type system , here 's how you would define a type with a recursive method .
__label__anger	i can not seem to figure out why the phpunit target does not output any test results even though i have tests in position . the problem i am finding is there is no indication as to what the problem is ! incredibly frustrating . the output is as follows : my build . xml is as follows : my system : vista , php , phpunit , phpundercontrol , cruisecontrol
__label__anger	okay so say we have a graph with a ball on it at ( ) and we swipe our finger from ( , ) to ( ) how do i go about moving the ball to ( ) ? this should be simple but it is really hurting my head ! this is the code i have so far ( using andengine )
__label__anger	after reading i was horrified ! is n't there a tool out there that can inspect a . h / .cpp file and deduce what dependencies could be waivered ?
__label__anger	horrible answer because it is just wrong .
__label__anger	i have created a vb . net lending application for a cooperative that caters to widows . the application tracks the members ' loans and payments , and is also used as an accounting system . in my first release , the users felt that showing a messagebox every time an error occurs is very annoying . my solution is to output errors in a label control . the users accepted the modification , but i feel i am doing it wrong .
__label__anger	this is a terrible idea , as a compact on a database already in a suspect state can lose data that would otherwise be recoverable before the compact . compact on close should under all circumstances be turned off .
__label__anger	seconds between asking and answering it yourself ? is n't that abusing the system a little ?
__label__anger	another thing i hate to see is the : i 've seen this in real code .
__label__anger	- votes ? ? people who have downvoted this answer should have specified the reason for doing so as well .
__label__anger	i 've tried msysgit and git on cygwin . both work just fine in and of themselves and both run gitk and git - gui perfectly . now how the heck do i configure a mergetool ? ( vimdiff works on cygwin , but preferrably i would like something a little more user - friendly for some of our more … windows - loving coworkers . ) thanks !
__label__anger	i want to catch all url 's in the root folder of the url www.example.com the url can not end in a trailing slash , and ca n't contain any slashes at all . so these should pass : www.example.com/abc www.example.com/abc123-asdf www.example.com/abc123/ ** fail ! www.example.com/asdfsd/asdf ** fail !
__label__anger	the ebook summarises thread . suspend and thread . resume thusly : the deprecated suspend and resume methods have two modes â € “ dangerous and useless ! the book recommends using a synchronization construct such as an or to perform thread suspending and resuming .
__label__anger	i have a . net assembly that has a com + servicedcopmonent in it and at the moment i install it into the gac to get everything working . this means that i need to have every assembly that it references in the gac as well . during development it is quite painful to make changes to thes assemblies , re-install them to the gac and then test . is it possible to maintain the com + component but not have everything in the gac ?
__label__anger	i need to pass a regex substitution as a variable : this , of course , does n't work . i tried eval'ing the substitution : but that did n't work either . what horribly obvious thing am i missing here ?
__label__anger	why would you want to do that ? ? no offense , but that is the most annoying and useless ' feature ' ever !
__label__anger	is there a way to run a specific ant task via the keyboard ? i have a rsync to dev task that i run a lot and running to the mouse to double - click is a pain .
__label__anger	i have a column containing the strings ' operator ( ) ' and so on until ' operator ( ) ' so far . i want to get them numerically ordered and i 've come up with which is very very ugly . better suggestions ?
__label__anger	background : i 'm currently debugging an application written over a custom - built gui framework in c ++ . i 've managed to pin down most bugs , but the bugs i 'm having the most trouble with tend to have a common theme . all of them seem to be to do with the screen refreshing , redrawing or updating to match provided data . this is a pain to debug , because i ca n't break on every refresh , and most of this stuff is time - sensitive , so breakpoints occasionally " fix " the bug . q : does anyone have any tips for debugging windows - based guis , especially regarding the refreshing of individual components ?
__label__anger	something that has always bugged me is how unpredictable the method in javascript is . in my experience , the timer is horribly inaccurate in a lot of situations . by inaccurate , i mean the actual delay time seems to vary by - ms more or less . although this is n't a huge amount of time , when using it to hide / show ui elements the time can be visibly noticeable . are there any tricks that can be done to ensure that performs accurately ( without resorting to an external api ) or is this a lost cause ?
__label__anger	i 've been trimming the ui of our website by doing the following in the onload event of that control : this has become very tedious because there are so many controls to check again and again . as soon as i get it all working , designers request to change the ui and then it starts all over . any suggestions ?
__label__anger	it is extremely unreliable and if there are constant builds going you never know the actual build is broke .
__label__anger	the built in ones are awful . you can easily write your own rss , rdf and atom parsers . i have a tutorial and a full visual studio project you can download that does just that http://www.jarloo.com/rumormill- /
__label__anger	what you are asking is inherently impossible . the game runs on the client and is therefore completely at the user 's mercy . only way to be sure is running a real time simulation of the game on the server based on user 's input ( mouse movement , keypresses ) , which is absolutely ridiculous .
__label__anger	if another person says nunit , i am gon na puke ! where tf did you people learn to read ?
__label__anger	suppose i have this interface and this class is there a way , or is there a tool that can let me automatically put in the comments of each member in a base class or interface ? because i hate re-writing the same comments for each derived sub-class !
__label__anger	i would agree except they are related and i really hated the idea of writing separate questions since they seemed to close .
__label__anger	that 's really bad . gwt looks extremely ugly with ie8 default !

__label__anger	is there a way to zoom extents of a collection of shapes without computing min / max xy 's and wh 's - very painful when sloping lines are involved . perhaps some kind of pixel detection ?
__label__anger	i 'm new to ror and am finding the scattered documentation extremely frustrating ! when the commands rails generate model or rails scaffold are any fileds automatically created . i 'm thinking here about the id field in particular . additionally , could anyone point me to the documentation which specifies this ?
__label__anger	combining nh attributes and some fnh automapping stuff looks very scary . i do not understand it at all but imo classic classmap is much more transparent . you must pay with more key strokes but your head hurts less :) . and this code deletes connection and endpoint as well from database :
__label__anger	your formatting is absolutely horrible to read . could you fix that ?
__label__anger	what an awful api !
__label__anger	we in the process of building an ios app ( it 's yet to be launched ) . we are trying to implement push notifications as part of the build . we have set this up via amazon sns and have created and registered an app certificate for the app which contains push notification permissions . basically we send the app message from server code - it states that it has been published and it returns the message id but the device does n't receive anything . to clarify the device registers ok for remote notifications and returns a device token . very frustrating ! does anyone have any tips ?
__label__anger	i agree , we often face this problem when using 10g xe databases , this is really annoying !
__label__anger	triggering quirks mode is a terrible , terrible , terrible thing . in quirks mode , jquery is forced to use alternative methods to interact with the dom and is almost definitely the cause of your speed issues in ie .
__label__anger	i am trying to generate api documentation via cabal and haddock . i want it to be latex . so i do : this fails ultimately with : is there something i can do or is something wrong with haddock ? fyi , i have to use cabal since the build process is rather complicated ( lots of preprocessors , ffi libraries , ... ) . invoking haddock manually is really painful . building html documentation however is working completely as expected . the complete output is at . i am using :
__label__anger	@sjdowling when downvoting someone you are suggested to explain why …
__label__anger	one non-technical consideration . embedding free data inside english phrases is n't going to look very smooth in many cultures ( including western ones ) , where you need grammatical agreement on e.g. number , gender or case . a more telegraphic style usually helps ( e.g. excellent input : " xyz " ) -- then at least everybody gets the same level of clunkiness !
__label__anger	ok , finally got this to work . horrible documentation online ! i 'm posting my code in case others are having trouble :
__label__anger	been looking at this for days …
__label__anger	that is incredibly frustrating !
__label__anger	i have a somewhat complicated issue . i have a grid defined ( using the struts2 - jquery grid plugin ) . one of the columns has a custom formatter that calls a javascript function to put a button into that column . ( note : i absolutely hate doing it that way ) . the point of the button is to open up a dialog box . this dialog box contains a checkboxlist , which ca n't be rendered in the grid . somehow , i need to pass a parameter to the action that returns the view that will be displayed inside the dialog . since this is somewhat complex , here is the code : grid definition : javascript custom formatter : dialog definition : remote manage roles jsp ( trimmed ) : since i get the id of the grid object via javascript , but use the jsp taglib for the dialog , how can i pass the id around ?
__label__anger	android apps are constrained to a certain amount of memory . as it 's quite ( insanely ? ) low , i think you should n't feel guilty about using all of it ! the limit is mb on very old devices , mb or mb on newer ones . there does n't seem to be much info on the size for different devices , and nobody seems to know why the limit is so small when modern phones have - gb of ram . aha , i found some concrete numbers on the limit : g1 : 16mb droid : 24mb nexus one : 32mb xoom : 48mb

__label__anger	i got iphone app . when i start it , i see black view . this black view is shown before app 's first view . and it looks really awful . can i set here preview picture ?

__label__anger	link ( burstproject . org ) is inactive and seems to have reverted to horrible go daddy wall of links / ads .
__label__anger	@gnud : no , it 's not an implementation detail . it makes it a pain when you 've been given an integer in " natural " base ( i.e. jan = ) and you need to use it with the calendar api .
__label__anger	you should fix the libraries that are creating bad or non-named threads . i 'd hate to debug your libraries ' threads only to find that the names where changes elsewhere .
__label__anger	upvote for the / f i 've written couple of scripts for that but without / f it was such a pain ; required me to be there when running the script to type " y + [ return ] "
__label__anger	i have several hundred ( static - no includes or server - side parsing ) html pages . i would like to validate the html ( xhtml transitional ) , but the idea of plugging each of them individually into the w3c validator - or even using a firefox plug - in to open each one - fills me with dread . does anyone know of any ( windows ) apps that can do bulk validation ? the " validate entire site " feature on is the closest i 've come , but that 's limited to pages .
__label__anger	yep , the power tools should let you do this , but unfortunately the merge goes horribly wrong each time so it 's next to useless .
__label__anger	im not sure what they 're called but im referring to the keywords in c ++ . is there an equivalent in c # ? it seems rather tedious having to repeat yourself ! ala
__label__anger	so for my text parsing in c # , i got directed at yaml . i 'm hitting a wall with this library i was recommended , so this is a quickie . and so on . is that valid ?
__label__anger	@andy : give him the useless use of cat award !

__label__anger	i have this strange problem on my web page where if you click below the left side - panel , all the links get highlighted . it happens in firefox , not ie . i do n't know why its only the side - panel that it happens to . its not really a big deal but its extremely annoying to me , is there any way to stop it ? if you want to check it out , the site is
__label__anger	i am trying to figure out why foundation is acting differently to expected behaviour . if you look at the kitchen sink page for foundation , the default styles for secondary buttons hover affect is different to what i get if i set foundation up in rails . note these images are from my rails application image - look at the ' . tiny . secondary ' button - no hover image - look at the ' . tiny . secondary ' button - with hover however on the page for foundation the color does not transition to the primary colour of the site . it transitions to a darker shade of grey . have i missed some setting ? really frustrating me ! i am guessing this is a bug in foundation
__label__anger	strange error . one of which i can not find any existing resources to solve the issue . the issue is , when using i get pointed to a folder at " c:\program files ( x86 ) \common files\microsoft shared\devserver\ " . naturally , this breaks everything which depends on the correct folder ( the one my solution is actually in ) being given . what is more strange is that there exists a unit - test to make sure that this path at least has the correct root folder and sometimes it will pass and will be working as expected , and then the very next debug , will point to the aforementioned folder again . very confusing and very annoying ! any ideas ?
__label__anger	in addition to firebug ( which should be your first port of call ) , the will also tell you where a given style is sourced from , just in case ie - shock , horror - should be different .
__label__anger	i really hate this option . i am looking at managing this by gpo in my org .
__label__anger	we are running jenkins on a server that does not have internet access ( even through proxy ) . installing and keeping the jenkins installation up-to - date is a pain ! my idea was to make a local mirror of the complete jenkins public update - site through a windows workstation that has internet access . and then make this local mirror available to jenkins through nfs share . so my questions : how to make the local mirror ? do you have a better / simpler idea to keep the jenkins installation up-to - date ?
__label__anger	i really hate thinking that code can tell me how to think instead of me telling it what to do ... anyway ... here is an example for loading the controller rendering the page , and it can load any controller inside the helper . edit : just realiced this is such an old post ☹️ ... this is working in cakephp
__label__anger	this is probably caused because you have set to ( which is absolutely terrible ) . ( see ) you should disable register globals so that the session / post / get / request / cookie variables do not interfere .
__label__anger	anyone ? ? ? i 'm starting to hate vs for that reason !
__label__anger	i 'm going crazy guys , my labels are not updated in my views after running "" and "" ! this is what i tried so far : make sure there is no "" strings around in po files delete mo files relaunch and delete all . files in my project delete browser cache change browser drop the local database and launch synchdb shout to the monitor the commands i launch are the following : is there any sort of django caching mechanism related to compiled mo files that i have to empty ? what can i do ? i 'm really furious ! 😐 '
__label__anger	@kolink oh , i hate facebook for many more reasons !
__label__anger	i have been trying to use offlineaudiocontext and the fft analyzer in chrome with a script processor but i am running into the same issue that this person has : in that so answer , someone pointed out this bug report : but it is over a year old ! my questions are : does anyone know if this will be fixed anytime soon and should i file a bug elsewhere ? is that bug report ( that is a year old ) still being looked at ? or better yet , maybe someone knows a workaround ? my code is essentially the same as the jsfiddle on that so link . it 's really sad that this stuff does n't work in chrome but it does in firefox .
__label__anger	too slow and i prefer to operate in the same mode as my users . also , i just really hate switching to debug . and its a waste of diskspace .
__label__anger	it 's the most ugly ☹️ ☹️ ☹️
__label__anger	there is no tcp multicast , i 'd vote this down , but i do n't have enough reputation .
__label__anger	@gabrielepetronella i missed that link , i hate how stackoverflow removes the underline ! are you running it on a server or file protocol ?
__label__anger	it 's a command - line tool . unforunately xcode does n't use codesense for editing files outside a project , which is incredibly frustrating .
__label__anger	how absolutely terrible you ca n't set controls not to show up on the print
__label__anger	yes , same happened to me ... sometimes defines can be really horrible .
__label__anger	did you ever solve this problem ? i 've just come across it and it 's really annoying , especially because my video does n't even have audio !
__label__anger	xcode console not showing after exiting app and reopening . i put a simple nslog in the next screen that i push to and there is no logging of it in my console . this makes it a pain to debug ! i segue from one screen to a tabbar controller , if that helps ? has anyone encountered this issue ?
__label__anger	indeed , this is awful . a pity there is no option to change it . every other ide / editor i used opened tabs to the right .
__label__anger	i for checking whether the function exists yet . in summary : does that work for you ? if it does then you can just wrap in a loop . a bit less nasty than a settimeout !
__label__anger	downvote this is due to omitting " var " before " a " making it global and is unrelated to the question .
__label__anger	malice ? seriously though , it 's hard to account for formatting style sometimes . it 's largely a matter of personal taste . personally , i think that both forms are a little nasty unless you 're seriously restricted in terms of line - length .
__label__anger	i have an . ico file with icon sizes embedded in it being used as the main application icon and the system tray icon . when it shows up in the task bar the icon is using the 16x16 format which is desired . when the icon shows up in the notification area / system tray , it is using the 32x32 format and windows is rendering it down to a 16x16 icon , which looks horrible . how do i force windows to use the 16x16 icon size in the notification area ? here 's my code to put the icon in the system tray :
__label__anger	i wondered if it 's possible to set the editor windows tab width in eclipse . i hate it when i want to close several windows in a row and i always have to move the mouse . can i set eclipse to use only one width for every window tab ?
__label__anger	this is probably silly but very frustrating . using vs2008 with a c ++ project , when i 'm working normally , the breakpoints window is visible and active but when i 'm debugging it disappears and ca n't be shown . this is a problem if i want to edit the condition of a breakpoint while running . pressing the breakpoints window button does n't do anything and neither does pressing ctrl + alt + b does this happen to anybody else ? it 's a brand new install with visual assist and qt integration as extensions . same configuration with vs2005 does n't have any problems .
__label__anger	i do hate the plain id name . i strongly prefer to always use the invoice_id or a variant thereof . i always know which table is the authoritative table for the id when i need to , but this confuses me what 's worst of all is the mix you mention , totally confusing . i 've had to work with a database where almost always it was foo_id except in one of the most used ids . that was total hell .
__label__anger	notably , the debugger shows the string * with * escape characters . when the string is printed in the console , the escape characters are not included . " \ " code \ "" vs. " code " . this character limit is very annoying as it prevents you from copying , say , a long json string and then immediately pasting that string ( escape characters included ) as a test string variable in your code .
__label__anger	@devsolar i would like to use boost more , but its synergy with c ++ is terrible , and there are some rather … _ curious _ design decisions ( iostreams requires devices to be copyable , but makes streams noncopyable … oh , and also nonmovable - at least in the implementation i 'm using , maybe they fixed it ? ) .
__label__anger	would 've loved to . but there is no hash_map in the c ++ standard library , and phb 's do n't allow code outside of that .
__label__anger	i have a class , let 's call it linegraph , that renders a line graph . i need to subclass it , but the derived class is only used in one place and is coupled to the class that uses it . so i am using an inner class . i see two ways to do this : anonymous inner class named inner class i am not a fan of anonymous inner classes , because frankly i just think it looks really ugly . but in the case of a subclass that 's only used in one place , is a named inner class overkill ? what is the accepted practice ?
__label__anger	not an answer , but why on earth would you want items in a combo box ? that is a terrible way to store that much data .
__label__anger	i hated using uml tools till i found http://yuml.me/ which offers some sort of dsl to describe uml diagrams . no mouse - fiddleling any more 🙂 .
__label__anger	evaluation of what ? i may be being slow today , but i really do n't understand what your problem is . i 'm awful tempted to vote to close on the principle that i do n't see a real question .
__label__anger	is search and replace the only way to rename as asp control in the code behind file ? i find this extremely annoying , but it is the only way i can find . scenario : i 'll find a variable that needs renaming ( usually to meet naming convention ) i 'll rename the variable in the aspx / ascx file . i 'll have to go in the code behind files and search and replace . i get annoyed are there any better ways - preferably that would not touch a similarly named variable in another scope in the project . i 'm on vs2008 with resharper -- does vs2010 address this perhaps ?
__label__anger	why am i using over % cpu when just hovering some links ? as you can see in the video i uploaded : the cpu goes to > % cpu when i move my mouse over the links . my style for the items are as follows why ?
__label__anger	the function is extremely annoying because it uses a prototype or something insane like that . you 'd have to do an ampersand - call to override the prototype : . however , you are trying to transpose the matrix , not to it ( which would produce a continuous list like we could use an iterator in conjunction with : which works , but this is severely overthinking the problem . let 's just swap indices :
__label__anger	the search term on both stackoverflow and pinvoke . net yields zero results , so this should be worth asking . i 've been fiddling around on msdn and looking through win sdk * . h files all day , and feeling a bit out of my element . i 'm basically attempting to query the msrpc endpoint mapper with managed code . here is what i have so far : the above code is n't complete , but it illustrates my point . the code consistently returns : rpcmgmtepeltingnext : meaning parameter is incorrect according to . so i 'm basically stumped at this point , and i 'm sure it 's because of my extremely crappy pinvoke code .
__label__anger	why would you want to do that ? your use case sounds extremely malicious .
__label__anger	what a sad answer ! ! maybe i can just do n't install it , and leave the hell to user .
__label__anger	gridview ? and accept some answers , for crying out loud !
__label__anger	i kept a bitmap inside a movieclip , bitmap has been set to be smoothing . but when i changed the scale of this movieclip , it still got pixelated . do we have the way to avoid . it is really painful .
__label__anger	this is not the answer but i figured out a very sad workaround . extend the textview component class in the constructor of the subclass , fire off the code ... yuck
__label__anger	i just updated my macvim to and with it , it now changes directories to whatever file i 'm currently editing . i use peepopen , so it 's incredibly annoying to cd back to my project directory every time i want to edit a new file .
__label__anger	i am currently workin on a visual studio online hosted project that uses git for version control and have run into a problem with the team explorer menu . all of my collegues get this view when connecting to the project : but on my machine , im missing the tiles / buttons and have to right click the current branch , choose manage branches and from there , select changes / unsynced commits to handle my code which is extremely annoying . im using visual studio ultimate for this project , but i also have vs2012 installed .
__label__anger	never been this frustrated before … i hate uis ! will have to deal with them one day
__label__anger	to my limited knowledge , in android , any activity must belong to a given process . however , the book says : " the activity life cycle is not tied to the process life cycle . " that is to say , even if the process has been completely killed , its activities can still be alive ! what makes me confused is : because the input handlers of an activity are bound to the process . if the process has been killed , how do its activities react to the user 's inputs ?
__label__anger	i would guess it is doing basic sanity checking ( i.e. should anything have changed ) - to prevent unexpected source code changes ( i hate it when opening a file can cause side - effects - i 'm looking at you , dbml ! ) . on a side note , to force serialization generally ( i do n't think it will apply due to the above ) : the and are a convention used by the framework .
__label__anger	this is heinous . i would not allow such a thing to survive a code review .
__label__anger	it seems very tedious ! i have a nine table join to join together , where two of the tables is a inner join and the rest is left outer joins . is it doable in entity ?
__label__anger	for some reason that still hates me !
__label__anger	i am referring to this behaviour : ( windows does n't include the mouse cursor in the screen shot , i 'm hovered on the uppermost (+) here . ) i find this incredibly annoying in some cases , especially with larger methods . in , i have both checkboxes blank .
__label__anger	i now have this extremely ugly solution . anybody a better idea ?
__label__anger	okay , so given the overwhelmingly negative response , does anybody think db image storage is _ ever _ justified ?
__label__anger	i have a complex site that incorporates alot of javascript and it is getting absolutely killed by ie7 . how would i go about serving this code : html js in such a way that ie7 never gets the and therefore never hides ?
__label__anger	my first instinct is to branch normally ( using p4 integrate ) , and then use an ide or sed script to change the package names . but this makes future integration from the trunk extremely painful .
__label__anger	this is the third post i 've seen with people filtering by * ascii * char - code - it 's a terrible idea ! where are you getting these examples from ?
__label__anger	i think it should be a warning . generally speaking , the common rule is that ' you should treat warnings as errors ' . if i unintentionally write unreachable code , i will see it in the warnings , and fix it anyway . however , sometimes , like neil says , you intentionally create dead code , for debugging purposes or whatever reason . i 'd really , really hate it if the compiler would not let me do that .
__label__anger	i have run into this too . it is very annoying ! here 's why it might be happening . the width of your li items , plus any margins is more than the width of #maincontainer . that means the last li item spills over #maincontainer and the script will want to move that last bit in , leaving an extra click . one way to check this : assign an id to the last li , and make the width less , and see if that does n't fix it . if so you need to make the #maincontainer wider .
__label__anger	does n't mean nothing . you have to use
__label__anger	i realise this is probably an absolutely horrible way to do a query , and of course its not working . the point of it is to select users based on a date range and a keyword .
__label__anger	i think this 'll be what i 'm going to go with . i really hate dealing with xml files .
__label__anger	my goal is to write a cookie when the user authenticates . we are using a crappy framework that hides its source code and event model so when i use their login control i ca n't set a session timeout on it ! anyhow , i am trying to write a cookie when the user is logged in , and then refresh the cookie expire time on subsequent page views ( sliding expiration ) . so i figured i could initially create the cookie during application_authenticaterequest in teh global . asax but that seems to be firing even when the user has n't signed in yet . is that suppose to be the case ?
__label__anger	i 'm not sure why this answer was accepted . this simply is n't the correct answer . deadlocks can occur whenever you have multiple threads . there 's nothing inherent in gui programs that makes them more likely to happen . furthermore , they can easily happen even if you use begininvoke ( ) . brian ensink 's answer is the correct one .
__label__anger	apart from the books available from , i am looking for some links to any resources that could help in learning the vtk library . preferably , with example code and tutorials . google results have not been terribly informative for me . so i am asking here for links to vtk resources .
__label__anger	ugh , implicit joins ! i want to tear my eyeballs out looking at that .
__label__anger	i really fail to see the use case … if you will type print_var_name ( $foobar ) what 's so hard ( and different ) about typing print ( " foobar " ) instead ? because even if you were to use this in a function , you 'd get the local name of the variable … in any case , here 's the in case there 's something you need in there .
__label__anger	yes , these queries are horrible . do a regular join instead .
__label__anger	yes , the question mentioned it wo n't work . i was trying to describe why it was n't terribly important to even try to do it that way .
__label__anger	agreed . do n't do this , it makes people cry .
__label__anger	i do n't know why the editor is giving me so much trouble . at first the code blocks would n't do anything but indent , so i had to change it to pre tags . then my carefully numbered sequence is now all 1s . this thing is making me look ridiculous !
__label__anger	from my own experience , microsoft sql compact framework is a real no - go . it is really freaking slow and its query analyzer is just really poor . i had to ask my team to rewrite all the plumbing code of my windows mobile component to get rid of the awful performances of sql ce .
__label__anger	how awesome would it be if the delphi ide would put code in formats on the clipboard , so that code that is copied and pasted in e-mails or word - documents has proper highlighting instead of plain text ? !
__label__anger	but definitely agree that in % of cases office interop is horrible .
__label__anger	basically , the doctype determines how crazy ie is going to be . if you do n't set it to xhtml , or " strict " you 'll be living in a world of hurt when it comes to ie ( even if you set it , you 'll still be hating on ie , but it does make it a lot better ) .
__label__anger	tried this . failed miserably . see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ /how-to-use-linux-fonts-in-windows-qt

__label__anger	i am trying to search my bash history similarly as with ctrl - r , but to forward direction . it has been a pain for me , when i just hit once too often ctrl - r , to find the previous command again . how can you forward search your bash history similarly as in reverse searching ?
__label__anger	talks about consuming wcf services in silverlight , but claims : there will be no proxies , no generated code , no 3rd party utilities , and no disgusting " add service reference " usage . what is so wrong with me adding a service reference in my silverlight project ? are there hidden overheads ? or is it a case of fear of auto magic on the part of the author ?
__label__anger	the following code should show either the port or servername not both i always get both no matter what ? i have also tried the follwoing with no joy either ! ! i just can not get the condition to resolve thanks in advance
__label__anger	i could easily be wrong about that , most of my work is this horrid single threaded behemoth …
__label__anger	the minute you start down the road to control memory is the minute you start making a mistake . if you have requirements for memory , do n't use . net . if you do n't have requirements , stop worrying about memory . . net manages memory better than you ever could . stop it . leave it alone . no . bad . stop .

__label__fear	very scary ! 😮
__label__fear	my company is just starting to look at using wpf for migrating all of our year old business applications . these applications will most of the time be running on computers that have limited / old hardware . we are now a little worried that the hardware might be too limited for using wpf. we have installed family . show ( ) on an basic older computer and that seems to run ok . but we would like know what your experiences with wpf on older hardware is ? anyone out there willing to share some experiences with us ?
__label__fear	matt - can you revue the accepted answer . you have to scroll a long way to get to a [ pure javascript answer ] ( http://stackoverflow.com/a/ / ) and i fear some users just take the accepted answer as gospel and use antiquated libraries as a result .
__label__fear	is there a way to reuse a 3rd party control reference ? for example , i have this referenced in my app . xaml i do n't want to repeat this 3rd party control xml namespace on each page / control that needs a control from the library . is there anyway to centralize these references and use the prefix defined here ? the possibility of each control having a different prefix is also worrisome . in asp . net you would put a reference in the web . config and it was available globally , i 'm just looking to see if there is a similar method in wpf.

__label__fear	exactly why i 'm asking because that s what i fear !
__label__fear	if i plan to use data caching do i have to worry about conflicts when also using deferred loading ? it seems that with linq i am losing control of my data .
__label__fear	in general , how expensive is locking in java ? specifically in my case : i have a multi-threaded app in which there is one main loop that takes objects off a delayqueue and processes them ( using poll ( )) . at some point a different thread will have to remove errant elements from the queue ( using remove ( )) . given that the remove ( ) is relatively uncommon , i am worried that locking on each poll ( ) will result in slow code . are my worries justified ?
__label__fear	i 've always been a bit frightened of python . is it not a relatively massive leap from an ingrained web development mindset ?
__label__fear	that 's what i was thinking , but i am afraid it will bring confusion to the structure . i will need to add " set children " field to parent class which should not be used anywhere in the code , only for hibernate cascade deletion . do you think it is ok ?
__label__fear	i 'm having trouble setting the default character set of my jvm . ( and was a bit afraid of messing it up ! )
__label__fear	can anyone think of a quick , easy and fullproof way of listing only clearcase remote client views from unix ? ct lsview obviously lists all the views , and you could search by looking at the properties : section if you run a ct lsview - properties - full ( gives you properties : snapshot webview readwrite ) then use a regex or something , but i 'd be worried that someone calls their view ' webview ' or something . has anyone got a foolproof way ? am i missing a flag or something ? if only there was - fmt on lsview 😕
__label__fear	i have a page that uses excanvas to draw some images . while testing the new page in ie6 , one computer attempts to open office and install a missing component . if the office install is canceled the vml images appear . this problem only happens on one of my test machines but it still worries me . anyone seen this issue when using ie6 and excanvas before ?
__label__fear	i am aware of question , but not to sure how to map it to my current situation . ( rebase is scary , undoing rebase is double scary ! ) i started out with several different feature branches of my master : i wanted to merge them all together and check they worked before merging back onto the top of master , so i did a : then which leaves me with then i corrected some bits that did n't compile properly , and got the whole feature set to an acceptable state : my problem is that my colleagues tell me that we 're not ready for featurea . is there any way for me to keep all my work , but also revert to a situation where i can just rebase featurec on to feature b ?
__label__joy	haha great 🙂 happens to the best of us !
__label__joy	you must redraw your background with each change in your line ( thatâ€™s the canvas way ) donâ€™t worry , canvas is very fast at redrawing ! here is code and a fiddle :

__label__joy	i would like to be able to do " extend my windows desktop onto this monitor " via code . a powershell script would be idea . i have googled around a far amount and wmi seems the way forward but as i have zero knowledge in wmi i thought i would try here . hope someone can help ! cheers , zi
__label__joy	thanks for the recommendation . i 've just talked to them and i 'm getting a demo . it looks good on paper , i really hope its can handle what i 'm looking for .
__label__joy	makes completely sense . put the content there more in case any other folks want a quick place to find it outside of the developer pages . that said , if you do find a specific solution , please share as i am very interested ! am working on building an appengine app and utilizing maven with similar characteristics as yours this weekend !

__label__joy	here 's a secret . in the chrome dev tools , do a cpu profile run . after you have stopped capturing , at the bottom of the screen is a down triangle next to " heavy ( bottom up ) " . click the triangle and select " flame chart " . once you are in flame chart mode , you can zoom and pan to see the digest cycles , how long they take , and exactly what functions are being called . the flame chart is so incredibly useful for tracking down page load issues , ng - repeat performance problems , digest cycle problems ! i really do n't know how i was able to debug and profile before the flame chart . here is an example :

__label__joy	excellent ! php really is an impressive language .
__label__joy	you can do as followed:when your app is not started / running and you start from an notification , oncreate gets called . when your app is running ( background or foreground ) , and you start a new intent from an notification this method gets called : ( if you are using singletop ) to detect whether your app is running back - or foreground , you can simply set a boolean in onpause / onresume : hope it helps !
__label__joy	i frightened myself how quick i figured that out !
__label__joy	this gem is pure gold .
__label__joy	i 'm currently tuning a large app that uses l2s using the following process ( to great success ! ) start sql server profiler and create a trace using the ' tuning ' template that gets saved to a file . then interact with your app to exercise the slow spots . stop the trace then start up the database engine tuning advisor . you can load up the trace file you just created and have it suggest all sort of optimizations . i 've just created non-clustered indexes based on its suggestions and my app is easily % faster that it was before .
__label__joy	at the moment my divs load in one by one on page load . it 's absolutely fine ! though when i make an ajax request and then to the same container my code then loops through all of the divs on the page rather than the newly added divs ? my question is : how would i perform the same effect on only the newly added ajax success data ? jquery : html :
__label__joy	i absolutely hope for your sake that this library does not use the rtl rng ! ! ! ! !
__label__joy	there is a such thing as a [ sublime - project ] ( http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/ /projects.html) file which you could check into version control , but it seems like it could be overridden by syntax specific settings per the [ settings doc ] ( http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/ /settings.html), and people would likely have to use the project file to get the benefit . [ this blog ] ( http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/sublime-text- -project-bliss/) is also interesting and applicable .
__label__joy	works very fine with jquery !
__label__joy	this is definitely great for small stuff !
__label__joy	this code works absolutely fine !
__label__joy	@brodieg , but together , we are infinite bliss . did n't you feel that already ? 🙂
__label__joy	i 've used on pretty complex websites with great success 🙂 one caveat through ( this applies to all " fixes " i believe ) is that you can not make a background image of an element be transparent .
__label__joy	i 'm hoping someone familiar with using bliss with express will see this question .
__label__joy	excellent , good luck !
__label__joy	i 've used beautifulsoup for such things in the past with great success .
__label__joy	i am building advanced html tables with lots of css in them , what are the best tools out there for building advanced html css tables that could include dynamic elements like ajax driven features ( jquery ) . i use dreamweaver and eclipse but they just touch the surface of having a really great tool set to build with . if you use a great tool let me know about it :-)
__label__joy	this will recalculate the number of words whenever you stop typing for a while ( specifically , ms ) . enjoy !
__label__joy	i have two tables which looks like this : each news can only have one tag . what is the most effective way to handle inserts to the news table ? the tags table has like rows . i 'm only doing bulk inserts of approx . news at a time , around times per hour . i assume that i need some in-memory cache for the tags ? if the tag is not in the tags table , i need to insert it and set tagid to the newly inserted id . hope you 'll get the idea !
__label__joy	not to take anything away from the answer already accepted , but i was able to get the duration of an audio file ( several different formats , including ac3 , which is what i needed at the time ) using the namespace . this is part of . adding a reference to that made my code as simple as this … and it 's pretty fast , too ! here 's a reference for the class .
__label__joy	that 's the hope 🙂

__label__joy	i 've had great success with dockpanelsuite i may post some sample code to get you started but it 's fairly staright forward !
__label__joy	not sure if this is by design , but for now , from within python causes a javascript exception to be raised and displayed ( along with line and column numbers ) . great success !
__label__joy	this just saved me a lot of grief !

__label__joy	wow ! i have an idea of cool web app , and i will share it with you now . do you remember this xkcd strip : so , imagine the web - service on which high - school students list people they dated ( links to facebook profiles or smth ) , and the service provides recommendations whom to date next to create symmetric graph or any other fancy graph configuration .

__label__joy	please see : for an excellent fix ! much easier to implement and more versatile than the answer above .
__label__joy	there 's no such thing . any such log would have to be programmed into the database , so no worries , you do n't have to disable it since it does n't exist by default !
__label__joy	no worries - everything is easier with jquery !
__label__joy	please update and you will get to paradise 🙂

__label__joy	no , definitely not return " object " ! wcf should make use of datacontracts and define full implementations of the request and possibly response objects for each call . see these two excellent articles on datacontract basics : i have no idea why the developers of those services picked " object " as the return type - does n't make a whole lot of sense to me ! marc
__label__joy	i have just come across this great api : however , i would like to also retrieve the continent . is this even possible as i can not find it . maybe there is another api that is freely available that will offer city , country and continent ? i have tried googles ajax api but they do n't offer continent either . maybe i going to have to just convert what i already have into continents , how ? ! i hope this is n't too subjective ! thanks all
__label__joy	pagination is the same concept with or without sql. you just need your basic variables , then you can create the content you want . here 's some quasi-code : hope that helps you get started !

__label__joy	i know this is an old thread but still , i 'd like to share one more tool which i find extremely helpful and user - friendly : this is an online tool that will get you up and running in no time . it also features a variety of pretty nice layouts out of the box . here are two for example :
__label__joy	you should look into the sdl library ( ) as it supports multiple platforms and has bindings for a variety of programming languages . it also supports opengl . good luck !
__label__joy	if you need portable python audio library try . it certainly has a mac port . as for mp3 files : it 's certainly doable in " raw " python , only i 'm afraid you 'd have to code everything yourself 🙂 . if you can afford some external library i 've found some here .
__label__joy	if you 're running on windows , you could do something similar using powershell . this could be extended pretty easily to find all unversioned and ignored files and delete them . hope that 's helpful to someone !
__label__joy	there 's a discussion related to this and one . essentially , you use invoke to accomplish it . best of luck !
__label__joy	have you tried the and methods ? there is a that mentions the approach . also , in jdbc sun added the that allows you to get a unique handle on a row . the feature is supported by oracle and db2 . for sql server you will probably need a third party driver such as . good luck !
__label__joy	i do n't think that you can … but if you can i 'd love to see how !
__label__joy	this is better than mine . did n't know you could do a string array for formats . very nice !
__label__joy	pr0n for sure 🙂 )))))) ( kidding jonathan )
__label__joy	i feel extremely comfortable dealing with - bit powerpc assembly code , but i am completely lost when trying to make sense of x86 code . do any of the other common architectures like arm , mips , sparc etc have an easier than x86 instruction set ?
__label__joy	not only that , but as the software ages they feel the need to upgrade simply because they know , every time they reference it , that they 're using office , for example . great for upgrade encouragement ! although even better is a message on the splash screen , " version is available now ! "
__label__joy	@stonefree welcome to the future brave time traveller ! 😮 )
__label__joy __label__anger	i 'm pretty sure i never said " excellent abstraction " . it 's not meant to hide the details of the win32 api , it 's meant to provide a means to develop applications that use the win32 api faster , and more uniformly , while still making it easy to call directly into the win32 api when necessary or convenient . at that , it is excellent .

__label__love __label__joy	this is a great question … my approach for solving this question would be to ask : given a list of items , what is the popability of choosing two consecutive items from the list which are sorted . as the list becomes more sorted , the probability will approach % . to calculate this probability is relatively simple : i hope this helps !
__label__love __label__joy	thanks to the two of you that answered . what i ended up doing ( in case anyone else is interested ! ) was processing the openid login like normal , but not saving the new user to the database . instead , i stored their information in a session var and asked them for the remaining information before adding them to the db and logging them in. hope this helps !

__label__sadness	most dns servers do n't obey rfc1912 to be honest . its a sad thing about isps .
__label__sadness	since you 're testing legacy code i 'm assuming you ca n't refactor said code to have less dependencies ( e.g. by using the ) that leaves you with little options i 'm afraid . every header that was included for a type or function will need a mock object for that type or function for everything to compile , there 's little you can do …

__label__sadness	is n't generic , so your code is effectively : at that point is it clearer why you need the cast ? ( not that the cast will really anything at execution time , of course … ) you 're not calling which is what you really want to be doing , effectively . it 's just another case of java generics being a bit of a pain ☹️
__label__sadness	😭 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭

__label__surprise	why is this getting downvoted ? he got the terms ide and compiler mixed up , but it 's still an excellent question . he wants to know if sun makes an official ide , like microsoft does with their express products .
__label__surprise	is this visual studio specific or all c ++ projects behave this way ? why ? ?
__label__surprise __label__anger	we 're running into a really painful issue with honeycomb 's here , and i was wondering if anyone else has found a solution . the problem itself is quite simple : we frequently trigger background tasks in activity or , since most of our screens must display data loaded from a web service . while these tasks are running , we show the actionbar 's refresh spinner and animate it . the problem is : oncreate and onresume are executed before is , so at the point where we start the task , the refresh spinner does n't even exist . hence , it wo n't animate . i do n't see any simple way around this . i guess we could keep the information about a task being spawned in oncreate , and as soon as the actionbar becomes available , update it accordingly . but still , i ca n't believe a use case as common as this is so difficult to do with actionbar ?
__label__surprise __label__fear	omg i hope that is n't all in one file !
