__label__anger	i have an existing javascript / flash - interaction kludge that sucks terribly . now i 've decided it 'd be better to write a flash app that does the specific thing without the need to interact with javascript . therefore i 'd need to produce flash apps in linux , and i do n't have money to throw at adobe right now ( perhaps never if their software keeps being terrible ) . also not going to do software development on windows , have been there , conclusion : that 's not going to work well ever . so , any solutions ? free or open source ?
__label__anger	such awful code !
__label__anger	i had the same problem and ended up doing the same workaround . when i was done i did n't really hate it though , because it allowed me to free - up the uipageviewcontroller and all of it 's child uipageviewcontrollers and all of their resources when the user was n't actively using the tab .
__label__anger	i see that over on this question there is a request to say how to do something using linq to see if a property matches in a collection . however , is this the fastest reasonable process by which to do this ? i will be deploying something that requires a certain amount of resource management , and i want the application to be as responsive as can be , without making the code terribly hard to decipher when someone else , or myself come back to it later .
__label__anger	i have various files that i want to be ignored by svn when committing . i know that i can go into tortoisesvn and ignore them in various ways . i know that i can run svn propedit svn:ignore from the command line to do the same thing . the problem is that i have to have everyone on my team to do that , which is a pain . is there a way that i can put some file in a folder or set something in my svn repository that tells it to never check a certain file in ?
__label__anger	coding horror ! ! !
__label__anger	how can i get my error , logcat , debug , etc. tabs to go back to the bottom - middle of eclipse ? for some reason , they moved up between the package explorer and the code editor in a vertical arrangement - i really hate it when sections of an ide break off and dock to some seemingly arbitrary area .
__label__anger	does anyone commit qt to their own source control ? if so , how do you do it ? do you commit the whole qt directory or do you pick only the ones that your application needs ( bin / lib / include / src ) how do you handle the case when new qt version comes out ? i 'm asking because i 'm trying to setup build automation and qt moc is a bit of a pain….and just wondering how people handle committing 3rd party library in general .
__label__anger	i have a that has three views per cell , with three cell displaying on the view at one time ( for a total of nine views ) . think of it as a bookshelf . sometimes i can have as many as books . i 've added shadow to the with code that is this : when i add the shadow code , as seen above , scrolling performance is just totally killed and becomes choppy . each image has a different so the shadow has to be created for each item as it scrolls . anyone have any tips on how to add shadows to my images on a without having this issue ?
__label__anger	the documentation for the minitest - ci gem ( seemingly the only option for producing test results for a ci tool such as jenkins ) has the extremely annoying habit of not preserving the results of when invoked as - the test results from running minitest:models are deleted prior to running the rest of the tests . minitest - ci 's barely - extant documentation claims adding this to test_helper.rb will disable the troublesome auto-clean behavior , but it does n't : has anyone out there managed to get minitest - ci to preserve all the test result files ? i 'm reaching wits ' end here .

__label__anger	i am trying to save a listobject from a . net excel vsto workbook to a new sheet ( done ) and save that new sheet to a new workbook ( done ) without that workbook requiring the vsto customization file ( ! ! ! ! ! ) . has anyone had any luck with this ? the only way i 've had any success is just saving as a csv file but that 's not exactly acceptable in this case . i 'd rather not save to a csv just to copy back to a xls file . worksheet . saveas ( savedialog . filename , excel.xlfileformat.xlopenxmlworkbook )

__label__anger	usability notes : personally i hate when sites put the " forgot password " or " forgot username " or " help " links inbetween the password field , and the login button . as a keyboard user , i should n't have to tab over them to get to the submit button . better yet , also capture the enter keypress on the password field so that i can auto-submit with the enter key .
__label__anger	i 'm having an extremely frustrating error trying to code a simple encryption program on python . basically its rejecting on if / else statement by saying my syntax is invalid , and i have no idea what i did wrong . the : in the if input == " " : statement is what python highlights as incorrect .
__label__anger	from netstat - anp | grep i at two different times , i can see httpclient is not re-using my connections . i connect to the same host every time with different urls such as why is httpclient not just re-using the same connection to myhost . com every time ? i have the following code for intialization of the pool that i pass to httpclient … i see they are using an httproute and have localaddress in the equals which seems odd as httproute should be equal on just hostname and schema ( https / http ) and that is it , right ? does that have something to do with it ? is this a bug ? performance is very crappy having to re-establish https sockets every time ! ! ! ! !
__label__anger	ew , that sounds a bit ugly ! is it possible for an instance of a class to be created before its unit 's initialization section has run ? in other words could an instance of tmyobject try to use flogger before it 's been set in the initialization section ?
__label__anger	arrrghhh , how i hate those people who downvote answers without leaving a comment as for why the downvote …
__label__anger	then you should be more specified in asking the question . you confused me …
__label__anger	@kev its a deployment headache , you can ilmerge it in ... but still its an extra bit of luggage you need to worry about
__label__anger	one of the iis developers has an excellent walkthrough here : however , for the love of god why ?
__label__anger	@jj that was the mistake jj. plain oversight and extremely ridiculous .
__label__anger	for what it 's worth , nscollectionview does this too ( you can see it in action in the iconcollection sample code ) . they apparently wait for a " quiet period " in which you 've stopped dragging . i 've been trying to write a similar class , and it is definitely a pain to get the animations to run consistently and properly during the resize .
__label__anger	i am building the android os on mac osx ( lion ) , and eclipse as an ide . i am trying to understand certain parts of the os however this requires performing many searches throughout the project . these searches take or minutes on eclipse , and the way they are presented is also extremely annoying . also , i need a separate editor to open up the native files found in the os , since if they are opened in eclipse there is no color coding of the c ++ syntax . i feel that eclipse is really slowing me down - can anyone suggest a better ide for browsing the android os ( preferably free ) ?
__label__anger	this answer is not optimal because i have no clue which konrad you are referring to .
__label__anger	we have released a beta version of our software , and as we talked to people who started using it , we have found that a lot of the features ( which we thought were essential ) were not known and not used by the users . what are the possible ways to inform the application users about the features of the application ? i personally find the " tip of the day " popups extremely annoying and disable them quickly . are there better ways ?
__label__anger	i absolutely hate cluttered seed files . admittedly , it 's a personal preference and not a right or wrong . here 's what i did in my app at work to handle the significant volume of seed data we are required to use : my seeds . rb file : a sample seed file in the seeds / folder : this has the effect of loading our seed files in the desired order ( using _ then _ , etc. ) . it also breaks up our seeds into logical groupings and organizes them in such a way that , for our team , we can more easily manage them .
__label__anger	this has nothing to do with but everything to do with the absolutely awful markup of your html and the lack of . you 're going to want to wrap all of this " free - text " inside of a or two , and then make sure you 're putting the inside of the sample css : html :
__label__anger	i was afraid of that . poorly formatted code really bothers me . i guess i 'll learn to live with it .
__label__anger	the move to version is painful , i totally agree . our process has taken just as long ( and seems to be stretching out forever ) - especially coming away from rational suite into individual v7 products .

__label__anger	i 'm developing an osx application ( ) that runs with lsuielement set ( system menu only - no tray icon , does n't appear in cmd - tab ) . it works totally fine , but someone just pointed out that it has a blank process name in the activity monitor listing . just says nothing . everything else in there has a name . even other apps running at lsuielement . i 've tried to search around the web , but i ca n't spot anyone talking about this . what on earth should i be looking for ?
__label__anger	tools to automate alteration of markup code for any objective are a horribly frightful proposition . simply write your code correctly the first time . if you have archaic code then it likely has many other problems in addition to seo , and automatically imposing global changes can expose problems you may not be prepared to address .
__label__anger	here 's my hack that assumes arguments are all imaginary : ... horrible ! but what you ask for is n't really possible without for instance hacking to dispatch to a new subtype of java.lang.number . really it would make more sense to use a java or clojure complex number library .
__label__anger	i am trying to override control - meta - down arrow and control - meta - up arrow in emacs . i 've tried all sorts of combinations of : and : etc … but it always says : . this means it is only taking into account the . why is it ignoring the control ? ? i 've been working on this for hours and emacs online documentation with regards to key bindings is surprisingly absolutely terrible .

__label__anger	i 'm rethinking the design of my gui . i designed a few jframe with netbeans automated gui ( yes , i 'm lazy , and this generated code is often awful , i know ! ) , but now i want them to be jpanel ( actually , to inherit from another class that inherits jpanel ) . but i had the " setdefaultcloseoperation " modified , so my code is broken : setdefaultcloseoperation is impossible for a jpanel . since i ca n't modify the generated code , i was wondering : is there a way to make netbeans understand i changed my mind , and regenerate the code ?
__label__anger	i have just about finished adding all of the content to each page of my website . i 've noticed , however , when i navigate between links some of the pages shift to the right about px or so . this is extremely irritating . all of my pages are contained within the same container using a fluid grid . however , not all pages have the same amount of content . i noticed that pages with empty divs do n't shift when i navigate between them . however , if i navigate from a page with content to a page with little or no content , i see the shift . should this be happening if all of my pages are using the same container , same fluid grid ? does this make sense ? can you sense my desperation ?
__label__anger	stylecop has rules that seem to differ from ms 's prior style guides . for example , stylecop hates m _ and _ for prefixs to private members . also , the vs default code generation violates stylecop by putting using statements outside the namespace . * sigh *

__label__anger	i would tend to leave them open -- but open them with the file share permissions set to allow other readers and make sure you flush log output with every message . i hate programs which do n't even let you look at the logfile while they are running , or where the log file is n't flushed and lags behind what is happening .

__label__anger	also if someone could please let me know if my question is hard to understand , i will re-state . this is incredibly frustrating….suddenly my stylus files are not compiling at all , and i have not changed any code .

__label__anger	from my experiences so far , i 've concluded that the html5 manifest scheme was really terribly designed . my site serves a manifest file when a user is logged in. unfortunately , when they log out , they can still access the cached protected materials . can anyone think of a way to fix this ?
__label__anger	i 'll bet you that your main 's function signature is incorrect . you use : but sdl_main.h wants aside : you see , sdl does something really horrific when compiling : it renames your function to , injecting its own main function which , in turn , calls yours . note that if this does n't work , then you may be compiling with wrong flags . to be sure , take the flags by running : for more information , see
__label__anger	i agree with this . for * non - essential services * increasing timeouts is incredibly frustrating .

__label__surprise	great ! i do n't know why but accepted answer is not working . do you know why ?
__label__surprise	whoops , just realized something….there 's no way for me to specify a max length when using string . string ( sbyte *) which basically means death to using the constructor for the purpose of reading out of a ring - buffer since it could keep reading past the max length into the next segment !

__label__love	i 'm absolutely loving breezejs and was so surprised to see that my enum values were being displayed as their text values and not their ordinal ones ! what i would love to be able to do is , on the client side , open the metadatastore , fetch the enumeration and modify it 's textual properties for display purposes . is this currently possible ? from my research it would appear not , but i 'm wondering if there is perhaps a simple workaround . everything i 've tried has involved a large number of hacks and server - side attributes , but to no avail , or the solution just seemed overly complex and not worth the benefits .

__label__love	@r … wow ! really great answer ! ! you should post it as an answer here , as it 's really more precise . just a question , though , when you say round for the alignment of the type , you mean that if for example on your example you had a short b instead of int b , it would be aligned to offset , instead of ?
__label__love	but they fixed it , and you do n't have to worry about it as long as you set the correct doctype , to make ie not be in quirks mode .

__label__love	i am using some php script to add some data from a complex form to mysql db and then showing it all in some html table . everything works just fine , but i would like to ' upgrade ' my script with jquery and ( i suppose ) ajax . what i would like to do is when user submits data , the row ( or ) shows up in the html table without refreshing a page . form and table are on same page , of course … some guidelines would be really helpful because i 'm not sure should i even use ajax or something else for my needs . links for some tutorials will be also great 🙂 thanks a lot for any help !

__label__fear	the fact that this is even remotely possible in javascript scares me .
__label__fear	no , and i would be very afraid if there was .
__label__fear	i 'm very worried about the following screen . when i launch " instruments " in allocations mode , i see every image of my app adding to " living " . i really do n't understand how it could be possible …
__label__fear	i 'm not good at programming and my trying to open one of my spreadsheet documents . below in the basic login im using , i then request a list all my spreadsheet , which is returned in $ feed . and now i 'm worried i 'm not on the right track with opening a document so i can read and write cells .
__label__fear	sometimes , i get scared of the abilities of ```` awk ```` !
__label__fear	why on my " git push " command i get the following very scaring error message ? i 've appended the text as it appeared on my shell , the strange symbols are shown . is my git installation broken ? my fist git clone was using https i 'm using on ubuntu x86_64
__label__fear	i would be extremely shocked if this was possible .
__label__fear	one of my tables in my sql database has a growth rate of two nibbles per nanosecond . i was wondering how many megabytes per day that is and should i be worried ? my hard disk is gb.
__label__surprise __label__anger	@iannewson whoops … i did n't see your answer … i just replied to this question as i have faced the same problem before . also the answer to the question is a very general one … there is nothing to copy here … it is not fair to downvote my answer … hope you understand ! ! cheers 🙂
__label__anger __label__sadness	i am using internet explorer . something annoying keeps happening when i add code to my site through the cms form that i use . take this line : let 's say i want to copy just this in ie , through the form on the page : when i go to copy just that section , it actually copies this : it is very annoying ! it does n't happen on chrome or firefox . for reasons with the cms i have to use internet explorer . is there a setting i can change so that does n't happen ? on windows if that helps . sorry if this does n't % fit with programming , someone let me know if there is a better place for this question .
__label__joy __label__fear	yeah , i understand you but i need to win the battle for today and tomorrow worry about the war !
__label__love __label__surprise	wow - why would someone vote to close ? this is a great debate ! !
__label__sadness	that 's very sad and the issue was opened a year ago …
__label__sadness	pity you have n't said what you are monitoring for . you should decide whether seconds is ok or not . feel free to drop it way lower if you wish ( and have a fast hdd ) no worries unless you are running a soft real - time system have a look at tools suggested in other answers . i 'll add another sugestion : " iotop " , for answering a " who is thrashing the hdd " questions .
__label__sadness	no answer yet … sad ☹️
__label__sadness	i usually do n't post meta comments , but 29k views and upvotes ? that is sad
__label__sadness	any ideas at all would be hugely appreciated - ca n't find anything about this anywhere ! 🙂
__label__sadness	that 's too sad ☹️
__label__sadness	sorry -- current output is raw html as far as i know . i 'll double check that , though . warren -- i suppose that is what i 'll have to do . looks quite scary , though !
__label__sadness	@sambo99 : i 'm really not sure what you mean , i 'm afraid .
__label__sadness	restoring splitter distances has given me a lot of grief too . i have found that restoring them from my user settings in the form ( or user control ) load event gave much better results than using the constructor . trying to do it in the constructor gave me all sorts of weird behaviour .
__label__sadness	just . net i 'm afraid 😕
__label__sadness	ok , i find the reason : device wo n't answer to simple user ( and does n't matter what permissions did you ask in program manifest ) . you can directly speak to device only if you are root ( or from kernel mode ) . that means you can not use devices directly from general applications . very sad ☹️
__label__sadness	it is really painfull to get all code form tfs whenever you make a build using nant . is there any settings in ccnet . config which will only take the files which are changed form last time which can speed up the process .
__label__sadness	lambdas automatically ' suck ' in local variables , i 'm afraid that 's simply how they work by definition .
__label__sadness	i need to develop a messenger - like text box , where certain tokens are being replaced with ui controls . just for example , if the user types 🙂 it should be replaced with a smiley image . i have previous experience with wpf 's richtextbox and i understand the concept of textpointer and textcontent . i just do n't know how to replace a textrange with a ui control … would extremely appreciate your help 🙂 ! gili
__label__sadness	the solution is crying out for the msmq solution but unfortunately the posting service is not on the domain . is there anyway to post to the public queue that is on the domain from the machine in the dmz ? i could use a webservice to post but this is a extra component to maintain . the database table is the alternative solution but again it is not the ideal .
__label__sadness	ah man , my changes did not save . jsfiddle was lagging terribly for me so i 'm not suprised -- sorry !
__label__sadness	i 'm afraid i gave up and switched to django instead !
__label__love __label__joy	excellent ! worked perfectly !
__label__love __label__joy	cool , that was going to be my next suggestion ! good luck 🙂
__label__love __label__joy	no worries ! keep at it….it 's overwhelming at first , but it gets easier
__label__love __label__joy	i solved it ! i used youtube api and it works fine 🙂 thank you for your help ! !
__label__love __label__joy	excellent ! thanks for the info .
__label__love __label__joy	@chris , excellent , i 'm thrilled to hear that you 're migrating to salted hashes ! 🙂
__label__joy __label__surprise	this is really weird . but a great question you posted ! nice to read . here could be a solution : http://stackoverflow.com/a/ /1320237why would it be impossible to import the calltips module from the standart library ? maybe you have a python idle open ? then they interfere ?
__label__surprise __label__fear	why all the down votes ?
__label__joy __label__anger	i have been struggling with the same issue , the facebook docs on this are awful , but finally i worked it out : hoe that helps !
__label__love __label__sadness	i do n't have whois installed on my server ( apparently it 's in the works but no real news on it ) . i was wondering if anybody knew a way to emulate the functionality of it though . i figured i 'd be posting some data to a url but i do n't know what , or where . basically i 'm at a complete loss , and would appreciate any help or even something that i could look into .
__label__joy	found the culprit ! at first i tried the solution suggested by @billinkc in the comment , it worked ( i managed to create a folder ) but the folder was n't usable as i could n't upload packages . i have db_owner permission on the msdb database and so i can see and access the ssis msdb folder . what i really needed was the db_ssisadmin permission . not to worry as db_owner permissions allow me to give myself the db_ssisadmin permission ! after this was done , all the problems ( the one in the original q and more ) disappeared .
__label__joy	after two weeks of painful search i finally found this !
__label__joy	ah , excellent 🙂
__label__joy	no worries ! i 've done the same thing many times on so .
__label__joy	' course i do , corrected .
__label__joy	your library should be named , with symlinks of and both pointing to that . the library should be created using in the linker command line ( or on the gcc command line ) . hope that helps !
__label__joy	i 've added to my answer to show a " code once and still be scalable " way of defining your font sizes . good luck with your project !
__label__joy	amazing how well this works ! i had excellent answers immediately ! it 's like i 'm living in the future !
__label__joy	it depends on the screen size because a ' screen with fhd will not have the same dpi as a ' screen with fhd. to know dpi i use this calculator : and for the folders please try the actual google documentation it is pretty complete : hope it helps !
__label__joy	i have found the from position absolute to just be that , absolutely awesome ! 🙂 . i have an on how to include it in asp . net mvc and in asp . net , you could just pass it the generated form id .
__label__joy	no worries , main thing is your problem gets solved !
__label__joy	that 's the hope 🙂
__label__joy	i have the following code : this code causes python to go in an infinite recursive loop , and the output is actually incredibly cool : this keeps growing exponentially 🙂 its pretty but why is this happening ?
__label__joy	is there a shorthand for a new line character in scala ? in java ( on windows ) i usually just use " \ n " , but that does n't seem to work in scala - specifically outputs in eclipse , ( sic ) from the command line , and from the repl ( great success ! ) works , but is there anything shorter ?
__label__joy	wow , friendly people here , mins and up votes !
__label__joy	no . just size permgen appropriately . it 's no different to having to size the heap appropriately . do n't be afraid !
__label__joy	so , it is as simple as purchasing a domain name , and then adding that identifying information to the hosts file ? if so , that is excellent ! !
__label__joy	excellent , i 'm glad that worked for you !
__label__joy	i think you should be able to make your connection without doing a lot of contortions with your database . it 's just a matter of getting the right connection string in your code . check out this very excellent reference -- scroll down for sql express tips . http://www.connectionstrings.com/sql-server-
__label__joy	godd luck , hope you figure it out ! 🙂
__label__joy	fantastic ! this makes using ipython with -- profile sh the best possible method for me to do this 🙂
__label__joy	hey i just had to solve this on a project i am working on , here is my answer then in my configuration ( i am using fluent nhibernate to configure my unit tests in code ) awesomenessssssss !
__label__joy	@gary well , you _ do _ get a non return code if ` rm - rf ` fails to delete at least one file ; as i said , tune to your needs 😉
__label__joy	there is a particularly efficient algorithm using de bruijn sequences described on sean eron anderson 's excellent page : it works in operations without branching !
__label__joy	upvote fast and furious , or should i say , you are fast and i am furious ! ` 😛 `
__label__joy	hmm , not sure where to find an example … basically , if there could be a page in admin that i could have a text area for a user to edit that would replace text somewhere in my theme , that would be excellent !
__label__joy	please do have a look at django - rest - framework , i just stepped over from tastypie to this new framework , works great ! especially the class based views and the browsable api ! and many other advantages ( e .. g. to upload images )
__label__joy	you might want to poke around in , and also the . another place where you can specifically ask questions is the yahoo users group for toad - send an email to toad - subscribe@yahoogroups.com hope this helps ! mike
__label__joy	wow ! actually , that 's nearly what @markseemann wrote , but in code 🙂 hope that helps .
__label__joy	horray for android !
__label__joy	there are some really great answers here that i wholeheartedly agree with !
__label__joy	fantastic that 's exactly what i was looking for !
